Binary Lua modules: best practices for Unix


Key points
----------
    * don't hard-code Lua header, library, or module paths in your build script
    * use pkg-config tool
    * use libtool, especially for modules to be loaded dynamically
    * for general modules which are to be published for use by various apps:
        * provide both static and dynamic library files


Real example
------------
In this directory is a minimal binary Lua module called "foo" which has
a single function "get_greeting" which returns a string.  The purpose
is to show how to build and use both dynamic and static modules in a
portable way (as far as Unix goes).

If you don't have libtool installed, try:

    $ apt-get install libtool

Build and run the dynamic test with:

    $ make test-dynamic

or the static test with:

    $ make test-dynamic
