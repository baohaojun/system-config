# NAME
#
#     deb3 - convert debian source package to new 3.0 (quilt) format
#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#     deb3 [quilt|dpatch|0|1|2|]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
# deb3 converts debian source packages which use series of patches from 
# 1.0 format to new 3.0 (quilt) format while adjusting contents in 
# debian/patches.  This is run from the package top level directory.
# If run without argument, deb3 guesses source structure.  Following 
# formats are auto detected.
#
#   * dh_quilt_patch/dh_quilt_unpatch
#   * dpatch
#   * cdbs (simple-patchsys.mk)
#   * dbs  (dbs-build.mk)
#
# ARGUMENT
#
# You can force particular conversion using argument.
#
#     quilt   conversion for dh_quilt_patch/dh_quilt_unpatch
#     dpatch  conversion for dpatch
#     0       conversion for dbs and cdbs made with -p 0 patches (default)
#     1       conversion for dbs and cdbs made with -p 1 patches
#     2       conversion for dbs and cdbs made with -p 2 patches

# Default patch level for cdbs and dbs 
# This may be overriden via environment variable or argument

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You need to make further modification to your package following 
debhelper(7) manpage.  This deb3 script only provides starting point to
you.  Typical modifications are:

 * "Build-Depends:" should remove "cdbs", "dpatch", and "quilt".
 * "Build-Depends:" should list "debhelper (>= 7.0.50~)"
 * Add "override_dh_*:" targets to debian/rules to address special 
   cases.

You can find tutorial for packaging using this new "dh \$@" style and 
new 3.0 (quilt) source format in the maint-guide package.  It is also 
availabe at:

   http://www.jp.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/index.en.html
