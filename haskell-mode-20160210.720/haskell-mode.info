3 Getting Started
*****************

3.1 Quick Installation
======================

Make sure you have this in your init file
(http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html)
(usually ‘~/.emacs‘).  If you already have ‘custom-set-variables’, merge
its contents:

     (require 'package)
     (custom-set-variables
      ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
      ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
      ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
      ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
      '(package-archives
        (quote
         (("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
          ("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/")))))

   Then run Emacs, and evaluate:

   ‘M-x package-refresh-contents’

   and then follow by

   ‘M-x package-install RET haskell-mode’

   Voila!  ‘haskell-mode’ is installed!  You should be able to edit
Haskell source code in color now.

3.2 Installation - more information
===================================

‘haskell-mode’ supports GNU Emacs versions 24 and upcoming 25
(snapshot).

   ‘haskell-mode’ is available from melpa-stable (releases)
(http://stable.melpa.org) and melpa (git snapshots) (http://melpa.org).

   Other means of obtaining ‘haskell-mode’ include el-get
(https://github.com/dimitri/el-get), Emacs Prelude
(https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) and Debian package
(https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=haskell-mode).

   Last version of ‘haskell-mode’ that supported Emacs 23 is
‘haskell-mode’ 13.18 available at
<https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode/releases/tag/v13.18>.

3.3 Customizing
===============

Most of ‘haskell-mode’’s settings are configurable via customizable
variables (*note (emacs)Easy Customization::, for details).  You can use

   ‘M-x customize-group <RET> haskell’ to browse the ‘haskell’
customization sub-tree.

   One of the important setting you should customize is the
‘haskell-mode-hook’ variable (*note (emacs)Hooks::) which gets run right
after the ‘haskell-mode’ major mode is initialized for a buffer.  You
can customize ‘haskell-mode-hook’ by ‘M-x customize-variable <RET>
haskell-mode-hook’.

4 Editing Haskell Code
**********************

"Haskell Mode" is actually a collection of so-called major modes(1) one
of which is called ‘haskell-mode’.  To avoid confusion, when referring
to this package the name “Haskell mode” is written in a normal font,
whereas when referring the major mode of the same name ‘haskell-mode’
written with a dash in-between in a typewriter font is used.

   As one might guess, ‘haskell-mode’ is the (programming language(2))
major mode for editing (non-literate) Haskell source code.
‘haskell-mode’ is associated with the file extensions listed below by
default(3).

‘.hs’
     official file extension for (non-literate) Haskell 98/2010 files
‘.hsc’
     “almost-Haskell” input file for the hsc2hs
     (http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/hsc2hs.html)
     pre-processor
‘.cpphs’
     input file for the cpphs (http://projects.haskell.org/cpphs/)
     pre-processor

The major mode ‘literate-haskell-mode’ (which is derived from
‘haskell-mode’ and thus transitively from ‘prog-mode’) provides support
for literate Haskell programs
(http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Literate_programming) and is
associated with the ‘.lhs’ file extension by default.

   ‘literate-haskell-mode’ supports Bird-style as well as TeX-style
literate Haskell files.  The currently detected literate Haskell variant
is shown in the mode line (*note (emacs)Mode Line::) as either
‘LitHaskell/bird’ or ‘LitHaskell/tex’.

4.1 Font Lock Support
=====================

‘haskell-mode’ supports "syntax highlighting" via Emacs’ Font Lock minor
mode which should be enabled by default in current Emacsen.  *Note
(emacs)Font Lock::, for more information on how to control
‘font-lock-mode’.

4.2 Managing imports
====================

There are a few functions for managing imports.

4.2.1 Jump to imports
---------------------

To jump to your import list, run

   ‘M-x haskell-navigate-imports’

   It’s nicer to have a keybinding to do this, for example:

     (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "<f8>") 'haskell-navigate-imports)

   You can hit it repeatedly to jump between groups of imports.  It will
cycle.

4.2.2 Format imports
--------------------

To generally format (sort, align) your imports, you can run

   ‘M-x haskell-mode-format-imports’

   Or ‘C-c C-.’.

4.2.3 Sort imports
------------------

To just sort imports, jump to an import section and run

   ‘M-x haskell-sort-imports’

4.2.4 Align imports
-------------------

To just align imports, jump to an import section and run

   ‘M-x haskell-align-imports’

4.2.5 Entering imports
----------------------

If you have Haskell Interactive Mode enabled and a session open, you can
write

   ‘import’

   And then hit ‘SPC’ (running ‘M-x haskell-mode-contextual-space’)
which will prompt a list of all modules, either installed modules or
local project directory files.  Then it’ll insert it and then format
that module section.

4.2.6 stylish-haskell
---------------------

As an alternative to the elisp functions described above, haskell-mode
can use the program stylish-haskell
(http://hackage.haskell.org/package/stylish-haskell) to format imports.
You can set this behavior by typing: ‘M-x customize-variable <RET>
haskell-stylish-on-save’.  You can install ‘stylish-haskell’ by running
‘stack install stylish-haskell’, or if you have not installed ‘stack’,
‘cabal install stylish-haskell’.

4.3 Completion support
======================

‘haskell-mode’ can complete symbols, pragma directives and language
extensions.  This is part of ‘haskell-interactive-mode’.

   If haskell-interactive-mode is enabled and working haskell mode
provides completions for import statements taking into account currently
loaded and available packages.

4.4 Profiling and Debugging support
===================================

When profiling code with GHC, it is often useful to add cost centres
(https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html#cost-centres)
by hand.  These allow finer-grained information about program behavior.
‘haskell-mode’ provides the function ‘haskell-mode-toggle-scc-at-point’
to make this more convenient.  It will remove an SCC annotation at point
if one is present, or add one if point is over whitespace.  By default
it is bound to ‘C-c C-s’.

File: haskell-mode.info,  Node: Unicode support,  Next: Indentation,  Prev: Editing Haskell Code,  Up: Top

5 Unicode support
*****************

See the Haskell Wiki’s entry on Unicode Symbols
(http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Unicode-symbols) for general
information about Unicode support in Haskell.

   As Emacs supports editing files containing Unicode out of the box, so
does Haskell Mode.  As an add-on, Haskell Mode includes the
‘haskell-unicode’ input method which allows you to easily type a number
of Unicode symbols that are useful when writing Haskell code; *Note
(emacs)Input Methods::, for more details.

   To automatically enable the ‘haskell-unicode’ input method in
haskell-mode buffers use ‘M-x customize-variable <RET>
haskell-mode-hook’ or put the following code in your ‘.emacs’ file:

     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-unicode-input-method)

To temporarily enable this input method for a single buffer you can use
‘M-x turn-on-haskell-unicode-input-method’.

   When the ‘haskell-unicode’ input method is active, you can simply
type ‘->’ and it is immediately replaced with ‘→’.  Use ‘C-\’ to toggle
the input method.  To see a table of all key sequences use ‘M-x
describe-input-method <RET> haskell-unicode’.  A sequence like ‘<=’ is
ambiguous and can mean either ‘⇐’ or ‘≤’.  Typing it presents you with a
choice.  Type ‘1’ or ‘2’ to select an option or keep typing to use the
default option.

   If you don’t like the highlighting of partially matching tokens you
can turn it off by setting ‘input-method-highlight-flag’ to ‘nil’ via
‘M-x customize-variable’.

6 Indentation
*************

For general information about indentation support in GNU Emacs, *note
(emacs)Indentation::.

   In Haskell, code indentation has semantic meaning as it defines the
block structure(1).

   As GNU Emacs’ default indentation function (i.e.  ‘indent-relative’)
is not designed for use with Haskell’s layout rule, Haskell mode
includes indentation rules adapted to Haskell.
‘haskell-indentation-mode’ binds <TAB> to cycle through possible
indentation points based on some clever heuristics.  <SHIFT-TAB> cycles
in the reverse direction, and <RET> moves to a new line and indents to
the first possible indentation level.

6.1 haskell-indent-mode
=======================

If you want to use the obsolete ‘haskell-indent-mode’, the recommended
way is to load it in ‘haskell-mode-hook’.  This can be done either by
using ‘M-x customize-variable <RET> haskell-mode-hook’ which provides a
convenient user interface or by adding the following line to your
‘.emacs’ file:

     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'haskell-indent-mode)

   This will turn off ‘haskell-indentation-mode’.

6.2 Interactive Block Indentation
=================================

‘haskell-indentation’ can move whole blocks to the left or to the right.
Just mark a block and then use <TAB> or <S-TAB>.

6.3 Rectangle Commands
======================

GNU Emacs provides so-called "rectangle commands" which operate on
rectangular areas of text, which are particularly useful for languages
with a layout rule such as Haskell.  *Note (emacs)Rectangles::, to learn
more about rectangle commands.

   Moreover, CUA mode (*note (emacs)CUA Bindings::) provides enhanced
rectangle support with visible rectangle highlighting.  When CUA mode is
active, you can initiate a rectangle selection by ‘C-RET’ and extend it
simply by movement commands.  You don’t have to enable full CUA mode to
benefit from these enhanced rectangle commands; you can activate CUA
selection mode (without redefining ‘C-x’,‘C-c’,‘C-v’, and ‘C-z’) by
calling ‘M-x cua-selection-mode’ (or adding ‘(cua-selection-mode nil)’
to your ‘haskell-mode-hook’).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Haskell also supports braces and semicolons notation for
conveying the block structure.  However, most Haskell programs written
by humans use indentation for block structuring.

7 Declaration scannning
***********************

‘haskell-decl-scan-mode’ is a minor mode which performs declaration
scanning and provides ‘M-x imenu’ support (*note (emacs)Imenu:: for more
information).

   For non-literate and TeX-style literate scripts, the common
convention that top-level declarations start at the first column is
assumed.  For Bird-style literate scripts, the common convention that
top-level declarations start at the third column, ie.  after ‘> ’, is
assumed.

   When ‘haskell-decl-scan-mode’ is active, the standard Emacs top-level
definition movement commands (*note (emacs)Moving by Defuns::) are
enabled to operate on Haskell declarations:

‘C-M-a’
     Move to beginning of current or preceding declaration
     (‘beginning-of-defun’).

‘C-M-e’
     Move to end of current or following declaration (‘end-of-defun’).

‘C-M-h’
     Select whole current or following declaration (‘mark-defun’).

   Moreover, if enabled via the option
‘haskell-decl-scan-add-to-menubar’, a menu item “Declarations” is added
to the menu bar listing the scanned declarations and allowing to jump to
declarations in the source buffer.

   It’s recommended to have font lock mode enabled (*note (emacs)Font
Lock::) as ‘haskell-decl-scan-mode’ ignores text highlighted with
‘font-lock-comment-face’.

   As usual, in order to activate ‘haskell-decl-scan-mode’ automatically
for Haskell buffers, add ‘haskell-decl-scan-mode’ to
‘haskell-mode-hook’:

     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'haskell-decl-scan-mode)

   ‘haskell-decl-scan-mode’ enables the use of features that build upon
‘imenu’ support such as Speedbar Frames (*note (emacs)Speedbar::) or the
global “Which Function” minor mode (*note (emacs)Which Function::).

   In order to enable ‘which-function-mode’ for Haskell buffers you need
to add the following to your Emacs initialization:

     (eval-after-load "which-func"
       '(add-to-list 'which-func-modes 'haskell-mode))

7.1 Speedbar
============

Haskell-mode comes with declaration scanning support.  This means that
if you enable Haskell support for speedbar:

     (speedbar-add-supported-extension ".hs")

   And open speedbar with

   ‘M-x speedbar’

   It gives a listing of each module and under each module:

         Imports
         Instances
         Data types
         Classes
         Bindings

   You will get a bar that looks like this:

~/Projects/ace/src/ACE/
0:<+> Types
0:[+] Combinators.hs
0:[-] Datalog.hs
1:   {-} Classes
2:      > ToTerm
1:   {-} Imports
2:      > ACE.Types.Syntax
2:      > Database.Datalog
1:   {-} Instances
2:    {+} ToTerm A
2:    {+} ToTerm Co to ToTerm Gen
2:    {+} ToTerm Intransitive to ToTerm N
2:    {+} ToTerm P
2:    {+} ToTerm Quotation to ToTerm Un

0:[-] Parsers.hs
1:   {+} Imports
1:   {-} Datatypes
2:      > ACEParser
0:[+] Pretty.hs
0:[+] Tokenizer.hs

   The hierarchy is expandable/collapsible and each entry will jump to
the line in the right file when clicked/selected.

8 Compilation
*************

Haskell mode comes equipped with a specialized "Compilation mode"
tailored to GHC’s compiler messages with optional support for Cabal
projects.  *Note (emacs)Compilation Mode::, for more information about
the basic commands provided by the Compilation mode which are available
in the Haskell compilation sub-mode as well.  The additional features
provided compared to Emacs’ basic Compilation mode are:

   • DWIM-style auto-detection of compile command (including support for
     CABAL projects)
   • Support for GHC’s compile messages and recognizing error, warning
     and info source locations (including ‘-ferror-spans’ syntax)
   • Support for filtering out GHC’s uninteresting ‘Loading package...’
     linker messages

   In order to use it, invoke the ‘haskell-compile’ command instead of
‘compile’ as you would for the ordinary Compilation mode.  It’s
recommended to bind ‘haskell-compile’ to a convenient key binding.  For
instance, you can add the following to your Emacs initialization to bind
‘haskell-compile’ to ‘C-c C-c’.

     (eval-after-load "haskell-mode"
         '(define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'haskell-compile))

     (eval-after-load "haskell-cabal"
         '(define-key haskell-cabal-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'haskell-compile))

The following description assumes that ‘haskell-compile’ has been bound
to ‘C-c C-c’.

   When invoked, ‘haskell-compile’ tries to guess how to compile the
Haskell program your currently visited buffer belongs to, by searching
for a ‘.cabal’ file in the current of enclosing parent folders.  If a
‘.cabal’ file was found, the command defined in the
‘haskell-compile-cabal-build-command’ option is used.  Note that to
compile a ‘stack’ based project you will need to set this variable to
‘stack build’.  As usual you can do it using ‘M-x customize-variable’ or
with:

     (setq haskell-compile-cabal-build-command "stack build")

   Moreover, when requesting to compile a ‘.cabal’-file is detected and
a negative prefix argument (e.g.  ‘C-- C-c C-c’) was given, the
alternative ‘haskell-compile-cabal-build-command-alt’ is invoked.  By
default, ‘haskell-compile-cabal-build-command-alt’ contains a ‘cabal
clean -s’ command in order to force a full rebuild.

   Otherwise if no ‘.cabal’ could be found, a single-module compilation
is assumed and ‘haskell-compile-command’ is used (_if_ the currently
visited buffer contains Haskell source code).

   You can also inspect and modify the compile command to be invoked
temporarily by invoking ‘haskell-compile’ with a prefix argument (e.g.
‘C-u C-c C-c’).  If later-on you want to recompile using the same
customized compile command, invoke ‘recompile’ (bound to ‘g’) inside the
‘*haskell-compilation*’ buffer.

9 Inferior Haskell interpreter
******************************

The major mode ‘inferior-haskell-mode’ provides support for interacting
with an inferior Haskell process based on ‘comint-mode’.

   By default the ‘haskell-mode-map’ keymap is setup to use this mode:

‘C-c C-z’
     is bound to ‘switch-to-haskell’
‘C-c C-b’
     is bound to ‘switch-to-haskell’
‘C-c C-l’
     is bound to ‘inferior-haskell-load-file’
‘C-c C-t’
     is bound to ‘inferior-haskell-type’
‘C-c C-i’
     is bound to ‘inferior-haskell-info’

   The Haskell interpreter used by the inferior Haskell mode is
auto-detected by default, but is customizable via the
‘haskell-program-name’ variable.

   Currently, GHCi and Hugs are support as Haskell interpreter.

   TODO/WRITEME


File: haskell-mode.info,  Node: Interactive Haskell,  Next: Editing Cabal files,  Prev: Inferior Haskell interpreter,  Up: Top

10 Interactive Haskell
**********************

An alternative mode providing a REPL (read–eval–print loop) via GHCi
sessions is called ‘haskell-interactive-mode’, which effectively
replaces ‘inferior-haskell-mode’, but comes with a different set of
features:

   • Separate sessions per Cabal project ‘haskell-session.el’.
   • A new inferior Haskell process handling code ‘haskell-process.el’.
   • New REPL implementation similiar to SLIME/IELM
   • Navigatable error overlays ‘haskell-interactive-mode.el’.

   In order to use ‘haskell-interactive-mode’ instead of the default
‘inferior-haskell-mode’, you need to replace some of the default
keybindings in the ‘haskell-mode-map’ keymap with the respective
‘haskell-interactive-mode’ counterparts:

     (eval-after-load "haskell-mode"
       '(progn
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-x C-d") nil)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-z") 'haskell-interactive-switch)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-l") 'haskell-process-load-file)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-b") 'haskell-interactive-switch)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-t") 'haskell-process-do-type)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-i") 'haskell-process-do-info)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c M-.") nil)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-d") nil)))

   With ‘haskell-interactive-mode’, each Haskell source buffer is
associated with at most one GHCi session, so when you call
‘haskell-process-load-file’ for a Haskell source buffer which has no
session associated yet, you’re asked which GHCi session to create or
associate with.

10.1 Goto Error
===============

In a Haskell source buffer associated with a GHCi session, errors that
prevent the file from loading are highlighted with ‘haskell-error-face’.
You can move between these error lines with

‘M-n’
     is bound to ‘haskell-goto-next-error’
‘M-p’
     is bound to ‘haskell-goto-prev-error’
‘C-c M-p’
     is bound to ‘haskell-goto-first-error’

10.2 Using GHCi-ng
==================

Put ‘:set +c’ in your ‘.ghci’ or run it in the REPL. Then use these
keybindings:

     (define-key interactive-haskell-mode-map (kbd "M-.") 'haskell-mode-goto-loc)
     (define-key interactive-haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-t") 'haskell-mode-show-type-at)

   You have to load the module before it works, after that it will
remember for the current GHCi session.

10.3 Customizing
================

What kind of Haskell REPL ‘haskell-interactive-mode’ will start up
depends on the value of ‘haskell-process-type’.  This can be one of the
symbols ‘auto’, ‘ghci’, ‘cabal-repl’, or ‘stack-ghci’.  If it’s ‘auto’,
the directory contents and available programs will be used to make a
best guess at the process type.  The actual process type will then
determine which variables ‘haskell-interactive-mode’ will access to
determine the program to start and its arguments:

   • If it’s ‘ghci’, ‘haskell-process-path-ghci’ and
     ‘haskell-process-args-ghci’ will be used.
   • If it’s ‘cabal-repl’, ‘haskell-process-path-ghci’ and
     ‘haskell-process-args-ghci’.
   • If it’s ‘stack-ghci’, ‘haskell-process-path-stack’ and
     ‘haskell-process-args-stack-ghci’ will be used.

   With each of these pairs, the the ‘haskell-process-path-...’ variable
needs to be a string specifying the program path, or a list of strings
where the first element is the program path and the rest are initial
arguments.  The ‘haskell-process-args-...’ is a list of strings
specifying (further) command-line arguments.

11 Editing Cabal files
**********************

‘haskell-cabal-mode’ is a major mode for editing Cabal package
description files
(http://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html) and
is automatically associated with files having a ‘.cabal’ extension.

   For quickly locating and jumping to the nearest ‘.cabal’ file from a
Haskell source buffer, you can use ‘M-x haskell-cabal-visit-file’; with
a prefix argument (i.e.  ‘C-u’) ‘find-file-other-window’ is used to
visit the ‘.cabal’ file.  ‘haskell-cabal-visit-file’ is bound to the key
sequence ‘C-c v c’.

12 Changing REPL target
***********************

With ‘haskell-session-change-target’ you can change the target for REPL
session.

   After REPL session started, in ‘haskell-interactive-mode’ buffer
invoke the ‘haskell-session-change-target’ and select from available
targets for

   - Testing

   - Benchmark

   - Executable

   - Library

   Answer “yes” to restart the session and run your tests, benchmarks,
executables.
