;;; Commentary:

;; Work with Git forges, such as Github and Gitlab, from the comfort
;; of Magit and the rest of Emacs.

;; The schema of the database has not been finalized yet.  Until that
;; has happened it will occasionally have to be discarded.  For now
;; the database does not contain any information that cannot simply
;; be fetched again.

Forge requires Git >= %s, you are using %s.

If this comes as a surprise to you, because you do actually have
a newer version installed, then that probably means that the
older version happens to appear earlier on the `$PATH'.  If you
always start Emacs from a shell, then that can be fixed in the
shell's init file.  If you start Emacs by clicking on an icon,
or using some sort of application launcher, then you probably
have to adjust the environment as seen by graphical interface.
For X11 something like ~/.xinitrc should work.

If you use Tramp to work inside remote Git repositories, then you
have to make sure a suitable Git is used on the remote machines
too.\n" forge--minimal-git version) :error))))
