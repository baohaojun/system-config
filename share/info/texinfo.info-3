23.2.4 Installing Info Directory Files
--------------------------------------

When you install an Info file onto your system, you can use the program
'install-info' to update the Info directory file 'dir'.  Normally the
makefile for the package runs 'install-info', just after copying the
Info file into its proper installed location.

  In order for the Info file to work with 'install-info', you include
the commands '@dircategory' and '@direntry'...'@end direntry' in the
Texinfo source file.  Use '@direntry' to specify the menu entries to add
to the Info directory file, and use '@dircategory' to specify which part
of the Info directory to put it in.  Here is how these commands are used
in this manual:

     @dircategory Texinfo documentation system
     @direntry
     * Texinfo: (texinfo).           The GNU documentation format.
     * install-info: (texinfo)Invoking install-info. ...
     ...
     @end direntry

  Here's what this produces in the Info file:

     INFO-DIR-SECTION Texinfo documentation system
     START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY
     * Texinfo: (texinfo).           The GNU documentation format.
     * install-info: (texinfo)Invoking install-info. ...
     ...
     END-INFO-DIR-ENTRY

The 'install-info' program sees these lines in the Info file, and that
is how it knows what to do.

  Always use the '@direntry' and '@dircategory' commands near the
beginning of the Texinfo input, before the first '@node' command.  If
you use them later on in the input, 'install-info' will not notice them.

  'install-info' will automatically reformat the description of the menu
entries it is adding.  As a matter of convention, the description of the
main entry (above, 'The GNU documentation format') should start at
column 32, starting at zero (as in 'what-cursor-position' in Emacs).
This will make it align with most others.  Description for individual
utilities best start in column 48, where possible.  For more information
about formatting see the '--calign', '--align', and '--max-width'
options in *note Invoking install-info::.

  If you use '@dircategory' more than once in the Texinfo source, each
usage specifies the 'current' category; any subsequent '@direntry'
commands will add to that category.

  When choosing a category name for the '@dircategory' command, we
recommend consulting the Free Software Directory
(http://www.gnu.org/directory).  If your program is not listed there, or
listed incorrectly or incompletely, please report the situation to the
directory maintainers (<bug-directory@gnu.org>) so that the category
names can be kept in sync.

  Here are a few examples (see the 'util/dir-example' file in the
Texinfo distribution for large sample 'dir' file):

     Emacs
     Localization
     Printing
     Software development
     Software libraries
     Text creation and manipulation

  Each 'Invoking' node for every program installed should have a
corresponding '@direntry'.  This lets users easily find the
documentation for the different programs they can run, as with the
traditional 'man' system.

23.2.5 Invoking 'install-info'
------------------------------

'install-info' inserts menu entries from an Info file into the top-level
'dir' file in the Info system (see the previous sections for an
explanation of how the 'dir' file works).  'install-info' also removes
menu entries from the 'dir' file.  It's most often run as part of
software installation, or when constructing a 'dir' file for all manuals
on a system.  Synopsis:

     install-info [OPTION]... [INFO-FILE [DIR-FILE]]

  If INFO-FILE or DIR-FILE are not specified, the options (described
below) that define them must be.  There are no compile-time defaults,
and standard input is never used.  'install-info' can read only one Info
file and write only one 'dir' file per invocation.

  If DIR-FILE (however specified) does not exist, 'install-info' creates
it if possible (with no entries).

  If any input file is compressed with 'gzip' (*note (gzip)Top::),
'install-info' automatically uncompresses it for reading.  And if
DIR-FILE is compressed, 'install-info' also automatically leaves it
compressed after writing any changes.  If DIR-FILE itself does not
exist, 'install-info' tries to open 'DIR-FILE.gz', 'DIR-FILE.xz',
'DIR-FILE.bz2', 'DIR-FILE.lz', and 'DIR-FILE.lzma', in that order.

  Options:

'--add-once'
     Specifies that the entry or entries will only be put into a single
     section.

'--align=COLUMN'
     Specifies the column that the second and subsequent lines of menu
     entry's description will be formatted to begin at.  The default for
     this option is '35'.  It is used in conjunction with the
     '--max-width' option.  COLUMN starts counting at 1.

'--append-new-sections'
     Instead of alphabetizing new sections, place them at the end of the
     DIR file.

'--calign=COLUMN'
     Specifies the column that the first line of menu entry's
     description will be formatted to begin at.  The default for this
     option is '33'.  It is used in conjunction with the '--max-width'
     option.  When the name of the menu entry exceeds this column,
     entry's description will start on the following line.  COLUMN
     starts counting at 1.

'--debug'
     Report what is being done.

'--delete'
     Delete the entries in INFO-FILE from DIR-FILE.  The file name in
     the entry in DIR-FILE must be INFO-FILE (except for an optional
     '.info' in either one).  Don't insert any new entries.  Any empty
     sections that result from the removal are also removed.

'--description=TEXT'
     Specify the explanatory portion of the menu entry.  If you don't
     specify a description (either via '--entry', '--item' or this
     option), the description is taken from the Info file itself.

'--dir-file=NAME'
     Specify file name of the Info directory file.  This is equivalent
     to using the DIR-FILE argument.

'--dry-run'
     Same as '--test'.

'--entry=TEXT'
     Insert TEXT as an Info directory entry; TEXT should have the form
     of an Info menu item line plus zero or more extra lines starting
     with whitespace.  If you specify more than one entry, they are all
     added.  If you don't specify any entries, they are determined from
     information in the Info file itself.

'--help'
     Display a usage message with basic usage and all available options,
     then exit successfully.

'--info-file=FILE'
     Specify Info file to install in the directory.  This is equivalent
     to using the INFO-FILE argument.

'--info-dir=DIR'
     Specify the directory where the directory file 'dir' resides.
     Equivalent to '--dir-file=DIR/dir'.

'--infodir=DIR'
     Same as '--info-dir'.

'--item=TEXT'
     Same as '--entry=TEXT'.  An Info directory entry is actually a menu
     item.

'--keep-old'
     Do not replace pre-existing menu entries.  When '--remove' is
     specified, this option means that empty sections are not removed.

'--max-width=COLUMN'
     Specifies the column that the menu entry's description will be
     word-wrapped at.  COLUMN starts counting at 1.

'--maxwidth=COLUMN'
     Same as '--max-width'.

'--menuentry=TEXT'
     Same as '--name'.

'--name=TEXT'
     Specify the name portion of the menu entry.  If the TEXT does not
     start with an asterisk '*', it is presumed to be the text after the
     '*' and before the parentheses that specify the Info file.
     Otherwise TEXT is taken verbatim, and is taken as defining the text
     up to and including the first period (a space is appended if
     necessary).  If you don't specify the name (either via '--entry',
     '--item' or this option), it is taken from the Info file itself.
     If the Info does not contain the name, the basename of the Info
     file is used.

'--no-indent'
     Suppress formatting of new entries into the 'dir' file.

'--quiet'
'--silent'
     Suppress warnings, etc., for silent operation.

'--remove'
     Same as '--delete'.

'--remove-exactly'
     Also like '--delete', but only entries if the Info file name
     matches exactly; '.info' and/or '.gz' suffixes are _not_ ignored.

'--section=SEC'
     Put this file's entries in section SEC of the directory.  If you
     specify more than one section, all the entries are added in each of
     the sections.  If you don't specify any sections, they are
     determined from information in the Info file itself.  If the Info
     file doesn't specify a section, the menu entries are put into the
     Miscellaneous section.

'--section REGEX SEC'
     Same as '--regex=REGEX --section=SEC --add-once'.

     'install-info' tries to detect when this alternate syntax is used,
     but does not always guess correctly.  Here is the heuristic that
     'install-info' uses:
       1. If the second argument to '--section' starts with a hyphen,
          the original syntax is presumed.

       2. If the second argument to '--section' is a file that can be
          opened, the original syntax is presumed.

       3. Otherwise the alternate syntax is used.

     When the heuristic fails because your section title starts with a
     hyphen, or it happens to be a filename that can be opened, the
     syntax should be changed to '--regex=REGEX --section=SEC
     --add-once'.

'--regex=REGEX'
     Put this file's entries into any section that matches REGEX.  If
     more than one section matches, all of the entries are added in each
     of the sections.  Specify REGEX using basic regular expression
     syntax, more or less as used with 'grep', for example.

'--test'
     Suppress updating of the directory file.

'--version'
     Display version information and exit successfully.

24 Generating HTML
******************

'makeinfo' generates Info output by default, but given the '--html'
option, it will generate HTML, for web browsers and other programs.
This chapter gives some details on such HTML output.

  'makeinfo' has many user-definable customization variables with which
you can influence the HTML output.  *Note Customization Variables::.

  'makeinfo' can also produce output in XML and Docbook formats, but we
do not as yet describe these in detail.  *Note Output Formats::, for a
brief overview of all the output formats.

* Menu:

* HTML Translation::       Details of the HTML output.
* HTML Splitting::         How HTML output is split.
* HTML CSS::               Influencing HTML output with Cascading Style Sheets.
* HTML Xref::              Cross references in HTML output.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: HTML Translation,  Next: HTML Splitting,  Up: Generating HTML

24.1 HTML Translation
=====================

'makeinfo' will include segments of Texinfo source between '@ifhtml' and
'@end ifhtml' in the HTML output (but not any of the other conditionals,
by default).  Source between '@html' and '@end html' is passed without
change to the output (i.e., suppressing the normal escaping of input
'<', '>' and '&' characters which have special significance in HTML).
*Note Conditional Commands::.

  By default, a navigation bar is inserted at the start of each node,
analogous to Info output.  If the '--no-headers' option is used, the
navigation bar is only inserted at the beginning of split files.  Header
'<link>' elements in split output can support Info-like navigation with
browsers like Lynx and Emacs W3 which implement this HTML 1.0 feature.

  In HTML, when the footnote style is 'end', or if the output is not
split, footnotes are put at the end of the output.  If set to
'separate', and the output is split, they are placed in a separate file.
*Note Footnote Styles::.

  The HTML generated is standard HTML 4.  It also tries to be as
compatible as possible with earlier standards (e.g., HTML 2.0,
RFC-1866).  Some minor exceptions: 1) HTML 3.2 tables are generated for
the '@multitable' command (*note Multi-column Tables::), but they should
degrade reasonably in browsers without table support; 2) The HTML 4
'lang' attribute on the '<html>' attribute is used; 3)  Entities that
are not in the HTML 3.2 standard are also used.  4)  CSS is used (*note
HTML CSS::).  5)  A few HTML 4 elements are used ('thead', 'abbr',
'acronym').

  Using '--init-file=html32.pm' produces strict HTML 3.2 output (*note
Invoking texi2any::).

  Please report output from an error-free run of 'makeinfo' which has
browser portability problems as a bug (*note Reporting Bugs::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: HTML Splitting,  Next: HTML CSS,  Prev: HTML Translation,  Up: Generating HTML

24.2 HTML Splitting
===================

When splitting output at nodes (which is the default), 'makeinfo' writes
HTML output into (basically) one output file per Texinfo source '@node'.

  Each output file name is the node name with spaces replaced by '-''s
and special characters changed to '_' followed by their code point in
hex (*note HTML Xref::).  This is to make it portable and easy to use as
a filename.  In the unusual case of two different nodes having the same
name after this treatment, they are written consecutively to the same
file, with HTML anchors so each can be referred to independently.

  If 'makeinfo' is run on a system which does not distinguish case in
file names, nodes which are the same except for case (e.g., 'index' and
'Index') will also be folded into the same output file with anchors.
You can also pretend to be on a case insensitive filesystem by setting
the customization variable 'CASE_INSENSITIVE_FILENAMES'.

  It is also possible to split at chapters or sections with '--split'
(*note Invoking texi2any::).  In that case, the file names are
constructed after the name of the node associated with the relevant
sectioning command.  Also, unless '--no-node-files' is specified, a
redirection file is output for every node in order to more reliably
support cross references to that manual (*note HTML Xref::).

  When splitting, the HTML output files are written into a subdirectory,
with the name chosen as follows:

  1. 'makeinfo' first tries the subdirectory with the base name from
     '@setfilename' (that is, any extension is removed).  For example,
     HTML output for '@setfilename gcc.info' would be written into a
     subdirectory named 'gcc/'.

  2. If that directory cannot be created for any reason, then 'makeinfo'
     tries appending '.html' to the directory name.  For example, output
     for '@setfilename texinfo' would be written to 'texinfo.html/'.

  3. If the 'NAME.html' directory can't be created either, 'makeinfo'
     gives up.

In any case, the top-level output file within the directory is always
named 'index.html'.

  Monolithic output ('--no-split') is named according to '@setfilename'
(with any '.info' extension is replaced with '.html'), '--output' (the
argument is used literally), or based on the input file name as a last
resort (*note @setfilename::).

24.3 HTML CSS
=============

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS for short) is an Internet standard for
influencing the display of HTML documents: see
<http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/>.

  By default, 'makeinfo' includes a few simple CSS commands to better
implement the appearance of some Texinfo environments.  Here are two of
them, as an example:

     pre.display { font-family:inherit }
     pre.smalldisplay { font-family:inherit; font-size:smaller }

  A full explanation of CSS is (far) beyond this manual; please see the
reference above.  In brief, however, the above tells the web browser to
use a 'smaller' font size for '@smalldisplay' text, and to use the same
font as the main document for both '@smalldisplay' and '@display'.  By
default, the HTML '<pre>' command uses a monospaced font.

  You can influence the CSS in the HTML output with two 'makeinfo'
options: '--css-include=FILE' and '--css-ref=URL'.

  The option '--css-ref=URL' adds to each output HTML file a '<link>'
tag referencing a CSS at the given URL.  This allows using external
style sheets.  You may find the file
'texi2html/examples/texinfo-bright-colors.css' useful for visualizing
the CSS elements in Texinfo output.

  The option '--css-include=FILE' includes the contents FILE in the HTML
output, as you might expect.  However, the details are somewhat tricky,
as described in the following, to provide maximum flexibility.

  The CSS file may begin with so-called '@import' directives, which link
to external CSS specifications for browsers to use when interpreting the
document.  Again, a full description is beyond our scope here, but we'll
describe how they work syntactically, so we can explain how 'makeinfo'
handles them.

  There can be more than one '@import', but they have to come first in
the file, with only whitespace and comments interspersed, no normal
definitions.  (Technical exception: an '@charset' directive may precede
the '@import''s.  This does not alter 'makeinfo''s behavior, it just
copies the '@charset' if present.)  Comments in CSS files are delimited
by '/* ... */', as in C.  An '@import' directive must be in one of these
two forms:

     @import url(http://example.org/foo.css);
     @import "http://example.net/bar.css";

  As far as 'makeinfo' is concerned, the crucial characters are the '@'
at the beginning and the semicolon terminating the directive.  When
reading the CSS file, it simply copies any such '@'-directive into the
output, as follows:

   * If FILE contains only normal CSS declarations, it is included after
     'makeinfo''s default CSS, thus overriding it.

   * If FILE begins with '@import' specifications (see below), then the
     'import''s are included first (they have to come first, according
     to the standard), and then 'makeinfo''s default CSS is included.
     If you need to override 'makeinfo''s defaults from an '@import',
     you can do so with the '! important' CSS construct, as in:
          pre.smallexample { font-size: inherit ! important }

   * If FILE contains both '@import' and inline CSS specifications, the
     '@import''s are included first, then 'makeinfo''s defaults, and
     lastly the inline CSS from FILE.

   * Any @-directive other than '@import' and '@charset' is treated as a
     CSS declaration, meaning 'makeinfo' includes its default CSS and
     then the rest of the file.

  If the CSS file is malformed or erroneous, 'makeinfo''s output is
unspecified.  'makeinfo' does not try to interpret the meaning of the
CSS file in any way; it just looks for the special '@' and ';'
characters and blindly copies the text into the output.  Comments in the
CSS file may or may not be included in the output.

  In addition to the possibilities offered by CSS, 'makeinfo' has many
user-definable customization variables with which you can influence the
HTML output.  *Note Customization Variables::.

24.4 HTML Cross References
==========================

Cross references between Texinfo manuals in HTML format become, in the
end, a standard HTML '<a>' link, but the details are unfortunately
complex.  This section describes the algorithm used in detail, so that
Texinfo can cooperate with other programs, such as 'texi2html', by
writing mutually compatible HTML files.

  This algorithm may or may not be used for links _within_ HTML output
for a Texinfo file.  Since no issues of compatibility arise in such
cases, we do not need to specify this.

  We try to support references to such "external" manuals in both
monolithic and split forms.  A "monolithic" (mono) manual is entirely
contained in one file, and a "split" manual has a file for each node.
(*Note HTML Splitting::.)

  The algorithm was primarily devised by Patrice Dumas in 2003-04.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: HTML Xref Link Basics,  Next: HTML Xref Node Name Expansion,  Up: HTML Xref

24.4.1 HTML Cross Reference Link Basics
---------------------------------------

For our purposes, an HTML link consists of four components: a host name,
a directory part, a file part, and a target part.  We always assume the
'http' protocol.  For example:

     http://HOST/DIR/FILE.html#TARGET

  The information to construct a link comes from the node name and
manual name in the cross reference command in the Texinfo source (*note
Cross References::), and from "external information" (*note HTML Xref
Configuration::).

  We now consider each part in turn.

  The HOST is hardwired to be the local host.  This could either be the
literal string 'localhost', or, according to the rules for HTML links,
the 'http://localhost/' could be omitted entirely.

  The DIR and FILE parts are more complicated, and depend on the
relative split/mono nature of both the manual being processed and the
manual that the cross reference refers to.  The underlying idea is that
there is one directory for Texinfo manuals in HTML, and a given MANUAL
is either available as a monolithic file 'MANUAL.html', or a split
subdirectory 'MANUAL/*.html'.  Here are the cases:

   * If the present manual is split, and the referent manual is also
     split, the directory is '../REFERENT/' and the file is the expanded
     node name (described later).

   * If the present manual is split, and the referent manual is mono,
     the directory is '../' and the file is 'REFERENT.html'.

   * If the present manual is mono, and the referent manual is split,
     the directory is 'REFERENT/' and the file is the expanded node
     name.

   * If the present manual is mono, and the referent manual is also
     mono, the directory is './' (or just the empty string), and the
     file is 'REFERENT.html'.

  Another rule, that only holds for filenames, is that base filenames
are truncated to 245 characters, to allow for an extension to be
appended and still comply with the 255-character limit which is common
to many filesystems.  Although technically this can be changed with the
'BASEFILENAME_LENGTH' customization variable (*note Other Customization
Variables::), doing so would make cross-manual references to such nodes
invalid.

  Any directory part in the filename argument of the source cross
reference command is ignored.  Thus, '@xref{,,,../foo}' and
'@xref{,,,foo}' both use 'foo' as the manual name.  This is because any
such attempted hardwiring of the directory is very unlikely to be useful
for both Info and HTML output.

  Finally, the TARGET part is always the expanded node name.

  Whether the present manual is split or mono is determined by user
option; 'makeinfo' defaults to split, with the '--no-split' option
overriding this.

  Whether the referent manual is split or mono, however, is another bit
of the external information (*note HTML Xref Configuration::).  By
default, 'makeinfo' uses the same form of the referent manual as the
present manual.

  Thus, there can be a mismatch between the format of the referent
manual that the generating software assumes, and the format it's
actually present in.  *Note HTML Xref Mismatch::.

24.4.2 HTML Cross Reference Node Name Expansion
-----------------------------------------------

As mentioned in the previous section, the key part of the HTML cross
reference algorithm is the conversion of node names in the Texinfo
source into strings suitable for XHTML identifiers and filenames.  The
restrictions are similar for each: plain ASCII letters, numbers, and the
'-' and '_' characters are all that can be used.  (Although HTML anchors
can contain most characters, XHTML is more restrictive.)

  Cross references in Texinfo can refer either to nodes or anchors
(*note @anchor::).  However, anchors are treated identically to nodes in
this context, so we'll continue to say "node" names for simplicity.

  A special exception: the Top node (*note The Top Node::) is always
mapped to the file 'index.html', to match web server software.  However,
the HTML _target_ is 'Top'.  Thus (in the split case):

     @xref{Top,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.
     => <a href="emacs/index.html#Top">

  1. The standard ASCII letters (a-z and A-Z) are not modified.  All
     other characters may be changed as specified below.

  2. The standard ASCII numbers (0-9) are not modified except when a
     number is the first character of the node name.  In that case, see
     below.

  3. Multiple consecutive space, tab and newline characters are
     transformed into just one space.  (It's not possible to have
     newlines in node names with the current implementation, but we
     specify it anyway, just in case.)

  4. Leading and trailing spaces are removed.

  5. After the above has been applied, each remaining space character is
     converted into a '-' character.

  6. Other ASCII 7-bit characters are transformed into '_00XX', where XX
     is the ASCII character code in (lowercase) hexadecimal.  This
     includes '_', which is mapped to '_005f'.

  7. If the node name does not begin with a letter, the literal string
     'g_t' is prefixed to the result.  (Due to the rules above, that
     string can never occur otherwise; it is an arbitrary choice,
     standing for "GNU Texinfo".)  This is necessary because XHTML
     requires that identifiers begin with a letter.

  For example:

     @node A  node --- with _'%
     => A-node-_002d_002d_002d-with-_005f_0027_0025

  Notice in particular:

   * '_' => '_005f'
   * '-' => '_002d'
   * 'A node' => 'A-node'

  On case-folding computer systems, nodes differing only by case will be
mapped to the same file.  In particular, as mentioned above, Top always
maps to the file 'index.html'.  Thus, on a case-folding system, Top and
a node named 'Index' will both be written to 'index.html'.  Fortunately,
the targets serve to distinguish these cases, since HTML target names
are always case-sensitive, independent of operating system.

24.4.3 HTML Cross Reference Command Expansion
---------------------------------------------

Node names may contain @-commands (*note Node Line Requirements::).
This section describes how they are handled.

  First, comments are removed.

  Next, any '@value' commands (*note @set @value::) and macro
invocations (*note Invoking Macros::) are fully expanded.

  Then, for the following commands, the command name and braces are
removed, and the text of the argument is recursively transformed:

     @asis @b @cite @code @command @dfn @dmn @dotless
     @emph @env @file @i @indicateurl @kbd @key
     @samp @sansserif @sc @slanted @strong @t @var @verb @w

For '@sc', any letters are capitalized.

  In addition, the following commands are replaced by constant text, as
shown below.  If any of these commands have non-empty arguments, as in
'@TeX{bad}', it is an error, and the result is unspecified.  In this
table, '(space)' means a space character and '(nothing)' means the empty
string.  The notation 'U+HHHH' means Unicode code point HHHH (in hex, as
usual).  There are further transformations of many of these expansions
for the final file or target name, such as space characters to '-',
etc., according to the other rules.

'@(newline)'           (space)
'@(space)'             (space)
'@(tab)'               (space)
'@!'                   '!'

'@questiondown'        U+00BF
'@registeredsymbol'    U+00AE

'@textdegree'          U+00B0
'@tie'                 (space)

  Quotation mark @-commands ('@quotedblright{}' and the like), are
likewise replaced by their Unicode values.  Normal quotation
_characters_ (e.g., ASCII ' and ') are not altered.  *Note Inserting
Quotation Marks::.

  Any '@acronym', '@abbr', '@email', and '@image' commands are replaced
by their first argument.  (For these commands, all subsequent arguments
are optional, and ignored here.)  *Note @acronym::, and *note @email::,
and *note Images::.

  Any other command is an error, and the result is unspecified.

24.4.4 HTML Cross Reference 8-bit Character Expansion
-----------------------------------------------------

Usually, characters other than plain 7-bit ASCII are transformed into
the corresponding Unicode code point(s) in Normalization Form C, which
uses precomposed characters where available.  (This is the normalization
form recommended by the W3C and other bodies.)  This holds when that
code point is '0xffff' or less, as it almost always is.

  These will then be further transformed by the rules above into the
string '_HHHH', where HHHH is the code point in hex.

  For example, combining this rule and the previous section:

     @node @b{A} @TeX{} @u{B} @point{}@enddots{}
     => A-TeX-B_0306-_2605_002e_002e_002e

  Notice: 1) '@enddots' expands to three periods which in turn expands
to three '_002e''s; 2) '@u{B}' is a 'B' with a breve accent, which does
not exist as a pre-accented Unicode character, therefore expands to
'B_0306' (B with combining breve).

  When the Unicode code point is above '0xffff', the transformation is
'__XXXXXX', that is, two leading underscores followed by six hex digits.
Since Unicode has declared that their highest code point is '0x10ffff',
this is sufficient.  (We felt it was better to define this extra escape
than to always use six hex digits, since the first two would nearly
always be zeros.)

  This method works fine if the node name consists mostly of ASCII
characters and contains only few 8-bit ones.  If the document is written
in a language whose script is not based on the Latin alphabet (for
example, Ukrainian), it will create file names consisting entirely of
'_XXXX' notations, which is inconvenient and all but unreadable.

  To handle such cases, 'makeinfo' offers the
'--transliterate-file-names' command line option.  This option enables
"transliteration" of node names into ASCII characters for the purposes
of file name creation and referencing.  The transliteration is based on
phonetic principles, which makes the generated file names more easily
understanable.

  For the definition of Unicode Normalization Form C, see Unicode report
UAX#15, <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/>.  Many related documents
and implementations are available elsewhere on the web.

24.4.5 HTML Cross Reference Mismatch
------------------------------------

As mentioned earlier (*note HTML Xref Link Basics::), the generating
software may need to guess whether a given manual being cross referenced
is available in split or monolithic form--and, inevitably, it might
guess wrong.  However, when the _referent_ manual is generated, it is
possible to handle at least some mismatches.

  In the case where we assume the referent is split, but it is actually
available in mono, the only recourse would be to generate a 'manual/'
subdirectory full of HTML files which redirect back to the monolithic
'manual.html'.  Since this is essentially the same as a split manual in
the first place, it's not very appealing.

  On the other hand, in the case where we assume the referent is mono,
but it is actually available in split, it is possible to use JavaScript
to redirect from the putatively monolithic 'manual.html' to the
different 'manual/node.html' files.  Here's an example:

     function redirect() {
       switch (location.hash) {
         case "#Node1":
           location.replace("manual/Node1.html#Node1"); break;
         case "#Node2" :
           location.replace("manual/Node2.html#Node2"); break;
         ...
         default:;
       }
     }

  Then, in the '<body>' tag of 'manual.html':

     <body onLoad="redirect();">

  Once again, this is something the software which generated the
_referent_ manual has to do in advance, it's not something the software
generating the cross reference in the present manual can control.

24.4.6 HTML Cross Reference Configuration: 'htmlxref.cnf'
---------------------------------------------------------

'makeinfo' reads a file named 'htmlxref.cnf' to gather information for
cross references to other manuals in HTML output.  It is looked for in
the following directories:

'./'
     (the current directory)

'./.texinfo/'
     (under the current directory)

'~/.texinfo/'
     (where '~' is the current user's home directory)

'SYSCONFDIR/texinfo/'
     (where SYSCONFDIR is the system configuration directory specified
     at compile-time, e.g., '/usr/local/etc')

'DATADIR/texinfo/'
     (likewise specified at compile time, e.g., '/usr/local/share')

  All files found are used, with earlier entries overriding later ones.
The Texinfo distribution includes a default file which handles many GNU
manuals; it is installed in the last of the above directories, i.e.,
'DATADIR/texinfo/htmlxref.cnf'.

  The file is line-oriented.  Lines consisting only of whitespace are
ignored.  Comments are indicated with a '#' at the beginning of a line,
optionally preceded by whitespace.  Since '#' can occur in urls (like
almost any character), it does not otherwise start a comment.

  Each non-blank non-comment line must be either a "variable assignment"
or "manual information".

  A variable assignment line looks like this:

     VARNAME = VARVALUE

  Whitespace around the '=' is optional and ignored.  The VARNAME should
consist of letters; case is significant.  The VARVALUE is an arbitrary
string, continuing to the end of the line.  Variables are then
referenced with '${VARNAME}'; variable references can occur in the
VARVALUE.

  A manual information line looks like this:

     MANUAL KEYWORD URLPREFIX

with MANUAL the short identifier for a manual, KEYWORD being one of:
'mono', 'node', 'section', 'chapter', and URLPREFIX described below.
Variable references can occur only in the URLPREFIX.  For example (used
in the canonical 'htmlxref.cnf'):

     G = http://www.gnu.org
     GS = ${G}/software
     hello mono    ${GS}/hello/manual/hello.html
     hello chapter ${GS}/hello/manual/html_chapter/
     hello section ${GS}/hello/manual/html_section/
     hello node    ${GS}/hello/manual/html_node/

  If the keyword is 'mono', URLPREFIX gives the host, directory, and
file name for MANUAL as one monolithic file.

  If the keyword is 'node', 'section', or 'chapter', URLPREFIX gives the
host and directory for MANUAL split into nodes, sections, or chapters,
respectively.

  When available, 'makeinfo' will use the "corresponding" value for
cross references between manuals.  That is, when generating monolithic
output ('--no-split'), the 'mono' url will be used, when generating
output that is split by node, the 'node' url will be used, etc.
However, if a manual is not available in that form, anything that is
available can be used.  Here is the search order for each style:

     node    => node,    section, chapter, mono
     section => section, chapter, node,    mono
     chapter => chapter, section, node,    mono
     mono    => mono,    chapter, section, node

  These section- and chapter-level cross-manual references can succeed
only when the target manual was created using '--node-files'; this is
the default for split output.

  If you have additions or corrections to the 'htmlxref.cnf' distributed
with Texinfo, please email <bug-texinfo@gnu.org> as usual.  You can get
the latest version from <http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/texinfo/htmlxref.cnf>.

24.4.7 HTML Cross Reference Link Preservation: MANUAL'-noderename.cnf'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Occasionally changes in a program require removing (or renaming) nodes
in the manual in order to have the best documentation.  Given the nature
of the web, however, links may exist anywhere to such a removed node
(renaming appears the same as removal for this purpose), and it's not
ideal for those links to simply break.

  Therefore, Texinfo provides a way for manual authors to specify old
node names and the new nodes to which the old names should be
redirected, via the file MANUAL'-noderename.cnf', where MANUAL is the
base name of the manual.  For example, the manual 'texinfo.texi' would
be supplemented by a file 'texinfo-noderename'.cnf.  (This name can be
overridden by setting the 'RENAMED_NODES_FILE' customization variable;
*note Customization Variables::).

  The file is read in pairs of lines, as follows:

     OLD-NODE-NAME
     @@{} NEW-NODE-NAME

  The usual conversion from Texinfo node names to HTML names is applied;
see this entire section for details (*note HTML Xref::).  The unusual
'@@{}' separator is used because it is not a valid Texinfo construct, so
can't appear in the node names.

  The effect is that 'makeinfo' generates a redirect from OLD-NODE-NAME
to NEW-NODE-NAME when producing HTML output.  Thus, external links to
the old node are preserved.

  Lines consisting only of whitespace are ignored.  Comments are
indicated with an '@c' at the beginning of a line, optionally preceded
by whitespace.

  Another approach to preserving links to deleted or renamed nodes is to
use anchors (*note @anchor::).  There is no effective difference between
the two approaches.

A.1 @-Command Syntax
====================

The character '@' is used to start all Texinfo commands.  (It has the
same meaning that '\' has in plain TeX.)  Texinfo has four types of
@-command:

1. Non-alphabetic commands.
     These commands consist of an @ followed by a punctuation mark or
     other character that is not part of the Latin alphabet.
     Non-alphabetic commands are almost always part of the text within a
     paragraph.  The non-alphabetic commands include '@@', '@{', '@}',
     '@.', '@SPACE', most of the accent commands, and many more.

2. Alphabetic commands that do not require arguments.
     These commands start with @ followed by a word followed by a left
     and right- brace.  These commands insert special symbols in the
     document; they do not take arguments.  Some examples: '@dots{}' =>
     '...', '@equiv{}' => '==', '@TeX{}' => 'TeX', and '@bullet{}' =>
     '*'.

3. Alphabetic commands that require arguments within braces.
     These commands start with @ followed by a letter or a word,
     followed by an argument within braces.  For example, the command
     '@dfn' indicates the introductory or defining use of a term; it is
     used as follows: 'In Texinfo, @@-commands are @dfn{mark-up}
     commands.'

4. Alphabetic commands that occupy an entire line.
     These commands occupy an entire line.  The line starts with @,
     followed by the name of the command (a word); for example,
     '@center' or '@cindex'.  If no argument is needed, the word is
     followed by the end of the line.  If there is an argument, it is
     separated from the command name by a space.  Braces are not used.

  Whitespace following an @-command name are optional and (usually)
ignored if present.  The exceptions are contexts whee whitespace is
significant, e.g., an '@example' environment.

  Thus, the alphabetic commands fall into classes that have different
argument syntaxes.  You cannot tell to which class a command belongs by
the appearance of its name, but you can tell by the command's meaning:
if the command stands for a glyph, it is in class 2 and does not require
an argument; if it makes sense to use the command among other text as
part of a paragraph, the command is in class 3 and must be followed by
an argument in braces; otherwise, it is in class 4 and uses the rest of
the line as its argument.

  The purpose of having a different syntax for commands of classes 3
and 4 is to make Texinfo files easier to read, and also to help the GNU
Emacs paragraph and filling commands work properly.  There is only one
exception to this rule: the command '@refill', which is always used at
the end of a paragraph immediately following the final period or other
punctuation character.  '@refill' takes no argument and does _not_
require braces.  '@refill' never confuses the Emacs paragraph commands
because it cannot appear at the beginning of a line.  It is also no
longer needed, since all formatters now refill paragraphs automatically.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Command Contexts,  Prev: Command Syntax,  Up: Command List

A.2 @-Command Contexts
======================

Here we describe approximately which @-commands can be used in which
contexts.  It merely gives the general idea and is not exhaustive or
meant to be a complete reference.  Discrepancies between the information
here and the 'makeinfo' or TeX implementations are most likely to be
resolved in favor of the implementation.

  By "general text" below, we mean anything except sectioning and other
such outer-level document commands, such as '@section', '@node', and
'@setfilename'.

  '@c', '@comment' and '@if ... @end if' conditional commands may appear
anywhere (except the conditionals must still be on lines by themselves).
'@caption' may only appear in '@float' but may contain general text.
'@footnote' content likewise.

  @-commands with braces marking text (such as '@strong', '@sc',
'@asis') may contain raw formatter commands such as '@html' but no other
block commands (other commands terminated by '@end') and may not be
split across paragraphs, but may otherwise contain general text.

  In addition to the block command restriction, on '@center', '@exdent'
and '@item' in '@table' lines, @-commands that makes only sense in a
paragraph are not accepted, such as '@indent'.

  In addition to the above, sectioning commands cannot contain
'@anchor', '@footnote' or '@verb'.

  In addition to the above, remaining commands ('@node', '@anchor',
'@printindex', '@ref', '@math', '@cindex', '@url', '@image', and so on)
cannot contain cross reference commands ('@ref', '@xref', '@pxref' and
'@inforef').  In one last addition, '@shortcaption' may only appear
inside '@float'.

  For precise and complete information, we suggest looking into the
extensive test suite in the sources, which exhaustively try
combinations.

Appendix B Tips and Hints
*************************

Here are some tips for writing Texinfo documentation:

   * Write in the present tense, not in the past or the future.

   * Write actively!  For example, write "We recommend that ..." rather
     than "It is recommended that ...".

   * Use 70 or 72 as your fill column.  Longer lines are hard to read.

   * Include a copyright notice and copying permissions.

Index, Index, Index!
....................

Write many index entries, in different ways.  Readers like indices; they
are helpful and convenient.

  Although it is easiest to write index entries as you write the body of
the text, some people prefer to write entries afterwards.  In either
case, write an entry before the paragraph to which it applies.  This
way, an index entry points to the first page of a paragraph that is
split across pages.

  Here are more index-related hints we have found valuable:

   * Write each index entry differently, so each entry refers to a
     different place in the document.

   * Write index entries only where a topic is discussed significantly.
     For example, it is not useful to index "debugging information" in a
     chapter on reporting bugs.  Someone who wants to know about
     debugging information will certainly not find it in that chapter.

   * Consistently capitalize the first word of every concept index
     entry, or else consistently use lowercase.  Terse entries often
     call for lowercase; longer entries for capitalization.  Whichever
     case convention you use, please use one or the other consistently!
     Mixing the two styles looks bad.

   * Always capitalize or use uppercase for those words in an index for
     which this is proper, such as names of countries or acronyms.
     Always use the appropriate case for case-sensitive names, such as
     those in C or Lisp.

   * Write the indexing commands that refer to a whole section
     immediately after the section command, and write the indexing
     commands that refer to a paragraph before that paragraph.

     In the example that follows, a blank line comes after the index
     entry for "Leaping":

          @section The Dog and the Fox
          @cindex Jumping, in general
          @cindex Leaping

          @cindex Dog, lazy, jumped over
          @cindex Lazy dog jumped over
          @cindex Fox, jumps over dog
          @cindex Quick fox jumps over dog
          The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

     (Note that the example shows entries for the same concept that are
     written in different ways--'Lazy dog', and 'Dog, lazy'--so readers
     can look up the concept in different ways.)

Blank Lines
...........

   * Insert a blank line between a sectioning command and the first
     following sentence or paragraph, or between the indexing commands
     associated with the sectioning command and the first following
     sentence or paragraph, as shown in the tip on indexing.  It makes
     the source easier to read.

   * Always insert a blank line before an '@table' command and after an
     '@end table' command; but never insert a blank line after an
     '@table' command.

     For example,

          Types of fox:

          @table @samp
          @item Quick
          Jump over lazy dogs.

          @item Brown
          Also jump over lazy dogs.
          @end table

          @noindent
          On the other hand, ...

     Insert blank lines before and after '@itemize' ... '@end itemize'
     and '@enumerate' ... '@end enumerate' in the same way.

Complete Phrases
................

Complete phrases are easier to read than ...

   * Write entries in an itemized list as complete sentences; or at
     least, as complete phrases.  Incomplete expressions ... awkward ...
     like this.

   * Write the prefatory sentence or phrase for a multi-item list or
     table as a complete expression.  Do not write "You can set:";
     instead, write "You can set these variables:".  The former
     expression sounds cut off.

Editions, Dates and Versions
............................

Include edition numbers, version numbers, and dates in the '@copying'
text (for people reading the Texinfo file, and for the legal copyright
in the output files).  Then use '@insertcopying' in the '@titlepage'
section for people reading the printed output (*note Short Sample::).

  It is easiest to handle such version information using '@set' and
'@value'.  *Note @value Example::, and *note GNU Sample Texts::.

Definition Commands
...................

Definition commands are '@deffn', '@defun', '@defmac', and the like, and
enable you to write descriptions in a uniform format.

   * Write just one definition command for each entity you define with a
     definition command.  The automatic indexing feature creates an
     index entry that leads the reader to the definition.

   * Use '@table' ... '@end table' in an appendix that contains a
     summary of functions, not '@deffn' or other definition commands.

Capitalization
..............

   * Capitalize "Texinfo"; it is a name.  Do not write the 'x' or 'i' in
     uppercase.

   * Capitalize "Info"; it is a name.

   * Write TeX using the '@TeX{}' command.  Note the uppercase 'T' and
     'X'.  This command causes the formatters to typeset the name
     according to the wishes of Donald Knuth, who wrote TeX.  (Likewise
     '@LaTeX{}' for LaTeX.)

Spaces
......

Do not use spaces to format a Texinfo file, except inside of '@example'
... '@end example' and other literal environments and commands.

  For example, TeX fills the following:

        @kbd{C-x v}
        @kbd{M-x vc-next-action}
           Perform the next logical operation
           on the version-controlled file
           corresponding to the current buffer.

so it looks like this:

     'C-x v' 'M-x vc-next-action' Perform the next logical operation on
     the version-controlled file corresponding to the current buffer.

In this case, the text should be formatted with '@table', '@item', and
'@itemx', to create a table.

@code, @samp, @var, and '---'
.............................

   * Use '@code' around Lisp symbols, including command names.  For
     example,

          The main function is @code{vc-next-action}, ...

   * Avoid putting letters such as 's' immediately after an '@code'.
     Such letters look bad.

   * Use '@var' around meta-variables.  Do not write angle brackets
     around them.

   * Use three hyphens in a row, '---', to indicate a long dash.  TeX
     typesets these as a long dash and the Info formatters reduce three
     hyphens to two.

Periods Outside of Quotes
.........................

Place periods and other punctuation marks _outside_ of quotations,
unless the punctuation is part of the quotation.  This practice goes
against some publishing conventions in the United States, but enables
the reader to distinguish between the contents of the quotation and the
whole passage.

  For example, you should write the following sentence with the period
outside the end quotation marks:

     Evidently, 'au' is an abbreviation for ``author''.

since 'au' does _not_ serve as an abbreviation for 'author.' (with a
period following the word).

Introducing New Terms
.....................

   * Introduce new terms so that a reader who does not know them can
     understand them from context; or write a definition for the term.

     For example, in the following, the terms "check in", "register" and
     "delta" are all appearing for the first time; the example sentence
     should be rewritten so they are understandable.

          The major function assists you in checking in a file to your
          version control system and registering successive sets of
          changes to it as deltas.

   * Use the '@dfn' command around a word being introduced, to indicate
     that the reader should not expect to know the meaning already, and
     should expect to learn the meaning from this passage.

Program Invocation Nodes
........................

You can invoke programs such as Emacs, GCC, and 'gawk' from a shell.
The documentation for each program should contain a section that
describes this.  Unfortunately, if the node names and titles for these
sections are all different, they are difficult for users to find.

  So, there is a convention to name such sections with a phrase
beginning with the word 'Invoking', as in 'Invoking Emacs'; this way,
users can find the section easily.

ANSI C Syntax
.............

When you use '@example' to describe a C function's calling conventions,
use the ANSI C syntax, like this:

     void dld_init (char *@var{path});

And in the subsequent discussion, refer to the argument values by
writing the same argument names, again highlighted with '@var'.

  Avoid the obsolete style that looks like this:

     #include <dld.h>

     dld_init (path)
       char *path;

  Also, it is best to avoid writing '#include' above the declaration
just to indicate that the function is declared in a header file.  The
practice may give the misimpression that the '#include' belongs near the
declaration of the function.  Either state explicitly which header file
holds the declaration or, better yet, name the header file used for a
group of functions at the beginning of the section that describes the
functions.

Node Length
...........

Keep nodes (sections) to a reasonable length, whatever reasonable might
be in the given context.  Don't hesitate break up long nodes into
subnodes and have an extensive tree structure; that's what it's there
for.  Many times, readers will probably try to find a single specific
point in the manual, using search, indexing, or just plain guessing,
rather than reading the whole thing from beginning to end.

  You can use the 'texi-elements-by-size' utility to see a list of all
nodes (or sections) in the document, sorted by size (either lines or
words), to find candidates for splitting.  It's in the 'util/'
subdirectory of the Texinfo sources.

Bad Examples
............

Here are several examples of bad writing to avoid:

  In this example, say, " ... you must '@dfn'{check in} the new
version."  That flows better.

     When you are done editing the file, you must perform a '@dfn'{check
     in}.

  In the following example, say, "... makes a unified interface such as
VC mode possible."

     SCCS, RCS and other version-control systems all perform similar
     functions in broadly similar ways (it is this resemblance which
     makes a unified control mode like this possible).

  And in this example, you should specify what 'it' refers to:

     If you are working with other people, it assists in coordinating
     everyone's changes so they do not step on each other.

And Finally ...
...............

   * Pronounce TeX as if the 'X' were a Greek 'chi', as the last sound
     in the name 'Bach'.  But pronounce Texinfo as in 'speck':
     "teckinfo".

   * Write notes for yourself at the very end of a Texinfo file after
     the '@bye'.  None of the formatters process text after the '@bye';
     it is as if the text were within '@ignore' ... '@end ignore'.

C.2 GNU Sample Texts
====================

Following is a sample Texinfo document with the full texts that should
be used (adapted as necessary) in GNU manuals.

  As well as the legal texts, it also serves as a practical example of
how many elements in a GNU system can affect the manual.  If you're not
familiar with all these different elements, don't worry.  They're not
required and a perfectly good manual can be written without them.
They're included here nonetheless because many manuals do (or could)
benefit from them.

  *Note Short Sample::, for a minimal example of a Texinfo file.  *Note
Beginning a File::, for a full explanation of that minimal example.

  Here are some notes on the example:

   * The '$Id:' comment is for the CVS (*note (cvs)Top::), RCS (*note
     (rcs)Top::) and other version control systems, which expand it into
     a string such as:

          $Id: texinfo.texi 5381 2013-09-26 23:03:58Z karl $

     (This is potentially useful in all sources that use version
     control, not just manuals.)  You may wish to include the '$Id:'
     comment in the '@copying' text, if you want a completely
     unambiguous reference to the documentation source version.

     If you want to literally write $Id$, use '@w': '@w{$}Id$'.
     Unfortunately, this technique does not work in plain text output,
     where it's not clear what should be done.

   * The 'version.texi' in the '@include' command is maintained
     automatically by Automake (*note (automake)Top::).  It sets the
     'VERSION' and 'UPDATED' values used elsewhere.  If your
     distribution doesn't use Automake, but you do use Emacs, you may
     find the time-stamp.el package helpful (*note (emacs)Time
     Stamps::).

   * The '@syncodeindex' command reflects the recommendation to use only
     one index where possible, to make it easier for readers to look up
     index entries.

   * The '@dircategory' is for constructing the Info directory.  *Note
     Installing Dir Entries::, which includes a variety of recommended
     category names.

   * The 'Invoking' node is a GNU standard to help users find the basic
     information about command-line usage of a given program.  *Note
     (standards)Manual Structure Details::.

   * It is best to include the entire GNU Free Documentation License in
     a GNU manual, unless the manual is only a few pages long.  Of
     course this sample is even shorter than that, but it includes the
     FDL anyway in order to show one conventional way to do so.  The
     'fdl.texi' file is available on the GNU machines and in the Texinfo
     and other GNU source distributions.

     The FDL provides for omitting itself under certain conditions, but
     in that case the sample texts given here have to be modified.
     *Note GNU Free Documentation License::.

   * If the FSF is not the copyright holder, then use the appropriate
     name.

   * If your manual is published on paper by the FSF or is longer than
     400 pages, you should include the standard FSF cover texts (*note
     (maintain)License Notices for Documentation::).

   * For documents that express your personal views, feelings or
     experiences, it is more appropriate to use a license permitting
     only verbatim copying, rather than the FDL.  *Note Verbatim Copying
     License::.

C.3 Verbatim Copying License
============================

For software manuals and other documentation, it is critical to use a
license permitting free redistribution and updating, so that when a free
program is changed, the documentation can be updated as well.

  On the other hand, for documents that express your personal views,
feelings or experiences, it is more appropriate to use a license
permitting only verbatim copying.

  Here is sample text for such a license permitting verbatim copying
only.  This is just the license text itself.  For a complete sample
document, see the previous sections.

C.4 All-permissive Copying License
==================================

For software manuals and other documentation, it is important to use a
license permitting free redistribution and updating, so that when a free
program is changed, the documentation can be updated as well.

  On the other hand, for small supporting files, short manuals (under
300 lines long) and rough documentation (README files, INSTALL files,
etc.), the full FDL would be overkill.  They can use a simple
all-permissive license.

  Here is sample text for such an all-permissive license.  This is just
the license text itself.  For a complete sample document, see the
previous sections.

Appendix D Page Headings
************************

Most printed manuals contain headings along the top of every page except
the title and copyright pages.  Some manuals also contain footings.
Headings and footings have no meaning in Info or the other output
formats.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Headings Introduced,  Next: Heading Format,  Up: Headings

D.1 Headings Introduced
=======================

Texinfo provides standard page heading formats for manuals that are
printed on one side of each sheet of paper and for manuals that are
printed on both sides of the paper.  Typically, you will use these
formats, but you can specify your own format if you wish.

  In addition, you can specify whether chapters should begin on a new
page, or merely continue the same page as the previous chapter; and if
chapters begin on new pages, you can specify whether they must be
odd-numbered pages.

  By convention, a book is printed on both sides of each sheet of paper.
When you open a book, the right-hand page is odd-numbered, and chapters
begin on right-hand pages--a preceding left-hand page is left blank if
necessary.  Reports, however, are often printed on just one side of
paper, and chapters begin on a fresh page immediately following the end
of the preceding chapter.  In short or informal reports, chapters often
do not begin on a new page at all, but are separated from the preceding
text by a small amount of whitespace.

  The '@setchapternewpage' command controls whether chapters begin on
new pages, and whether one of the standard heading formats is used.  In
addition, Texinfo has several heading and footing commands that you can
use to generate your own heading and footing formats.

  In Texinfo, headings and footings are single lines at the tops and
bottoms of pages; you cannot create multiline headings or footings.
Each header or footer line is divided into three parts: a left part, a
middle part, and a right part.  Any part, or a whole line, may be left
blank.  Text for the left part of a header or footer line is set
flushleft; text for the middle part is centered; and, text for the right
part is set flushright.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Heading Format,  Next: Heading Choice,  Prev: Headings Introduced,  Up: Headings

D.2 Standard Heading Formats
============================

Texinfo provides two standard heading formats, one for manuals printed
on one side of each sheet of paper, and the other for manuals printed on
both sides of the paper.

  By default, nothing is specified for the footing of a Texinfo file, so
the footing remains blank.

  The standard format for single-sided printing consists of a header
line in which the left-hand part contains the name of the chapter, the
central part is blank, and the right-hand part contains the page number.

  A single-sided page looks like this:

       _______________________
      |                       |
      | chapter   page number |
      |                       |
      | Start of text ...     |
      | ...                   |
      |                       |

  The standard format for two-sided printing depends on whether the page
number is even or odd.  By convention, even-numbered pages are on the
left- and odd-numbered pages are on the right.  (TeX will adjust the
widths of the left- and right-hand margins.  Usually, widths are
correct, but during double-sided printing, it is wise to check that
pages will bind properly--sometimes a printer will produce output in
which the even-numbered pages have a larger right-hand margin than the
odd-numbered pages.)

  In the standard double-sided format, the left part of the left-hand
(even-numbered) page contains the page number, the central part is
blank, and the right part contains the title (specified by the
'@settitle' command).  The left part of the right-hand (odd-numbered)
page contains the name of the chapter, the central part is blank, and
the right part contains the page number.

  Two pages, side by side as in an open book, look like this:

       _______________________     _______________________
      |                       |   |                       |
      | page number     title |   | chapter   page number |
      |                       |   |                       |
      | Start of text ...     |   | More  text ...        |
      | ...                   |   | ...                   |
      |                       |   |                       |

The chapter name is preceded by the word "Chapter", the chapter number
and a colon.  This makes it easier to keep track of where you are in the
manual.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Heading Choice,  Next: Custom Headings,  Prev: Heading Format,  Up: Headings

D.3 Specifying the Type of Heading
==================================

TeX does not begin to generate page headings for a standard Texinfo file
until it reaches the '@end titlepage' command.  Thus, the title and
copyright pages are not numbered.  The '@end titlepage' command causes
TeX to begin to generate page headings according to a standard format
specified by the '@setchapternewpage' command that precedes the
'@titlepage' section.

  There are four possibilities:

No '@setchapternewpage' command
     Cause TeX to specify the single-sided heading format, with chapters
     on new pages.  This is the same as '@setchapternewpage on'.

'@setchapternewpage on'
     Specify the single-sided heading format, with chapters on new
     pages.

'@setchapternewpage off'
     Cause TeX to start a new chapter on the same page as the last page
     of the preceding chapter, after skipping some vertical whitespace.
     Also cause TeX to typeset for single-sided printing.  (You can
     override the headers format with the '@headings double' command;
     *note @headings::.)

'@setchapternewpage odd'
     Specify the double-sided heading format, with chapters on new
     pages.

Texinfo lacks an '@setchapternewpage even' command.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Custom Headings,  Prev: Heading Choice,  Up: Headings

D.4 How to Make Your Own Headings
=================================

You can use the standard headings provided with Texinfo or specify your
own.  By default, Texinfo has no footers, so if you specify them, the
available page size for the main text will be slightly reduced.

  Texinfo provides six commands for specifying headings and footings:
   * '@everyheading' and '@everyfooting' generate page headers and
     footers that are the same for both even- and odd-numbered pages.
   * '@evenheading' and '@evenfooting' command generate headers and
     footers for even-numbered (left-hand) pages.
   * '@oddheading' and '@oddfooting' generate headers and footers for
     odd-numbered (right-hand) pages.

  Write custom heading specifications in the Texinfo file immediately
after the '@end titlepage' command.  You must cancel the predefined
heading commands with the '@headings off' command before defining your
own specifications.

  Here is how to tell TeX to place the chapter name at the left, the
page number in the center, and the date at the right of every header for
both even- and odd-numbered pages:

     @headings off
     @everyheading @thischapter @| @thispage @| @today{}

You need to divide the left part from the central part and the central
part from the right part by inserting '@|' between parts.  Otherwise,
the specification command will not be able to tell where the text for
one part ends and the next part begins.

  Each part can contain text or @-commands.  The text is printed as if
the part were within an ordinary paragraph in the body of the page.  The
@-commands replace themselves with the page number, date, chapter name,
or whatever.

  Here are the six heading and footing commands:

'@everyheading LEFT @| CENTER @| RIGHT'
'@everyfooting LEFT @| CENTER @| RIGHT'
     The 'every' commands specify the format for both even- and
     odd-numbered pages.  These commands are for documents that are
     printed on one side of each sheet of paper, or for documents in
     which you want symmetrical headers or footers.

'@evenheading LEFT @| CENTER @| RIGHT'
'@oddheading LEFT @| CENTER @| RIGHT'
'@evenfooting LEFT @| CENTER @| RIGHT'
'@oddfooting LEFT @| CENTER @| RIGHT'
     The 'even' and 'odd' commands specify the format for even-numbered
     pages and odd-numbered pages.  These commands are for books and
     manuals that are printed on both sides of each sheet of paper.

  Use the '@this...' series of @-commands to provide the names of
chapters and sections and the page number.  You can use the '@this...'
commands in the left, center, or right portions of headers and footers,
or anywhere else in a Texinfo file so long as they are between '@iftex'
and '@end iftex' commands.

  Here are the '@this...' commands:

'@thispage'
     Expands to the current page number.

'@thissectionname'
     Expands to the name of the current section.

'@thissectionnum'
     Expands to the number of the current section.

'@thissection'
     Expands to the number and name of the current section, in the
     format 'Section 1: Title'.

'@thischaptername'
     Expands to the name of the current chapter.

'@thischapternum'
     Expands to the number of the current chapter, or letter of the
     current appendix.

'@thischapter'
     Expands to the number and name of the current chapter, in the
     format 'Chapter 1: Title'.

'@thistitle'
     Expands to the name of the document, as specified by the
     '@settitle' command.

'@thisfile'
     For '@include' files only: expands to the name of the current
     '@include' file.  If the current Texinfo source file is not an
     '@include' file, this command has no effect.  This command does
     _not_ provide the name of the current Texinfo source file unless it
     is an '@include' file.  (*Note Include Files::, for more
     information about '@include' files.)

You can also use the '@today{}' command, which expands to the current
date, in '1 Jan 1900' format.

  Other @-commands and text are printed in a header or footer just as if
they were in the body of a page.  It is useful to incorporate text,
particularly when you are writing drafts:

     @headings off
     @everyheading @emph{Draft!} @| @thispage @| @thischapter
     @everyfooting @| @| Version: 0.27: @today{}

  Beware of overlong titles: they may overlap another part of the header
or footer and blot it out.

  If you have very short chapters and/or sections, several of them can
appear on a single page.  You can specify which chapters and sections
you want '@thischapter', '@thissection' and other such macros to refer
to on such pages as follows:

'@everyheadingmarks REF'
'@everyfootingmarks REF'
     The REF argument can be either 'top' (the '@this...' commands will
     refer to the chapter/section at the top of a page) or 'bottom' (the
     commands will reflect the situation at the bottom of a page).
     These '@every...' commands specify what to do on both even- and
     odd-numbered pages.

'@evenheadingmarks REF'
'@oddheadingmarks REF'
'@evenfootingmarks REF'
'@oddfootingmarks REF'
     These '@even...' and '@odd...' commands specify what to do on only
     even- or odd-numbered pages, respectively.  The REF argument is the
     same as with the '@every...' commands.

  Write these commands immediately after the '@...contents' commands, or
after the '@end titlepage' command if you don't have a table of contents
or if it is printed at the end of your manual.

  By default the '@this...' commands reflect the situation at the bottom
of a page both in headings and in footings.

Appendix E Catching Mistakes
****************************

Besides mistakes in the content of your documentation, there are two
kinds of mistake you can make with Texinfo: you can make mistakes with
@-commands, and you can make mistakes with the structure of the nodes
and chapters.

  Emacs has two tools for catching the @-command mistakes and two for
catching structuring mistakes.

  For finding problems with @-commands, you can run TeX or a region
formatting command on the region that has a problem; indeed, you can run
these commands on each region as you write it.

  For finding problems with the structure of nodes and chapters, you can
use 'C-c C-s' ('texinfo-show-structure') and the related 'occur' command
and you can use the 'M-x Info-validate' command.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: makeinfo Preferred,  Next: Debugging with Info,  Up: Catching Mistakes

E.1 'makeinfo' Preferred
========================

The 'makeinfo' program does an excellent job of catching errors and
reporting them--far better than 'texinfo-format-region' or
'texinfo-format-buffer'.  In addition, the various functions for
automatically creating and updating node pointers and menus remove many
opportunities for human error.

  If you can, use the updating commands to create and insert pointers
and menus.  These prevent many errors.  Then use 'makeinfo' (or its
Texinfo mode manifestations, 'makeinfo-region' and 'makeinfo-buffer') to
format your file and check for other errors.  This is the best way to
work with Texinfo.  But if you cannot use 'makeinfo', or your problem is
very puzzling, then you may want to use the tools described in this
appendix.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Debugging with Info,  Next: Debugging with TeX,  Prev: makeinfo Preferred,  Up: Catching Mistakes

E.2 Catching Errors with Info Formatting
========================================

After you have written part of a Texinfo file, you can use the
'texinfo-format-region' or the 'makeinfo-region' command to see whether
the region formats properly.

  Most likely, however, you are reading this section because for some
reason you cannot use the 'makeinfo-region' command; therefore, the rest
of this section presumes that you are using 'texinfo-format-region'.

  If you have made a mistake with an @-command, 'texinfo-format-region'
will stop processing at or after the error and display an error message.
To see where in the buffer the error occurred, switch to the '*Info
Region*' buffer; the cursor will be in a position that is after the
location of the error.  Also, the text will not be formatted after the
place where the error occurred (or more precisely, where it was
detected).

  For example, if you accidentally end a menu with the command '@end
menus' with an 's' on the end, instead of with '@end menu', you will see
an error message that says:

     @end menus is not handled by texinfo

The cursor will stop at the point in the buffer where the error occurs,
or not long after it.  The buffer will look like this:

     ---------- Buffer: *Info Region* ----------
     * Menu:

     * Using texinfo-show-structure::  How to use
                                      `texinfo-show-structure'
                                      to catch mistakes.
     * Running Info-validate::         How to check for
                                      unreferenced nodes.
     @end menus
     -!-
     ---------- Buffer: *Info Region* ----------

  The 'texinfo-format-region' command sometimes provides slightly odd
error messages.  For example, the following cross reference fails to
format:

     (@xref{Catching Mistakes, for more info.)

In this case, 'texinfo-format-region' detects the missing closing brace
but displays a message that says 'Unbalanced parentheses' rather than
'Unbalanced braces'.  This is because the formatting command looks for
mismatches between braces as if they were parentheses.

  Sometimes 'texinfo-format-region' fails to detect mistakes.  For
example, in the following, the closing brace is swapped with the closing
parenthesis:

     (@xref{Catching Mistakes), for more info.}

Formatting produces:
     (*Note for more info.: Catching Mistakes)

  The only way for you to detect this error is to realize that the
reference should have looked like this:

     (*Note Catching Mistakes::, for more info.)

  Incidentally, if you are reading this node in Info and type 'f <RET>'
('Info-follow-reference'), you will generate an error message that says:

     No such node: "Catching Mistakes) The only way ...

This is because Info perceives the example of the error as the first
cross reference in this node and if you type a <RET> immediately after
typing the Info 'f' command, Info will attempt to go to the referenced
node.  If you type 'f catch <TAB> <RET>', Info will complete the node
name of the correctly written example and take you to the 'Catching
Mistakes' node.  (If you try this, you can return from the 'Catching
Mistakes' node by typing 'l' ('Info-last').)

======================

You can also catch mistakes when you format a file with TeX.

  Usually, you will want to do this after you have run
'texinfo-format-buffer' (or, better, 'makeinfo-buffer') on the same
file, because 'texinfo-format-buffer' sometimes displays error messages
that make more sense than TeX.  (*Note Debugging with Info::, for more
information.)

  For example, TeX was run on a Texinfo file, part of which is shown
here:

     ---------- Buffer: texinfo.texi ----------
     name of the Texinfo file as an extension.  The
     @samp{??} are `wildcards' that cause the shell to
     substitute all the raw index files.  (@xref{sorting
     indices, for more information about sorting
     indices.)@refill
     ---------- Buffer: texinfo.texi ----------

(The cross reference lacks a closing brace.)  TeX produced the following
output, after which it stopped:

     ---------- Buffer: *tex-shell* ----------
     Runaway argument?
     {sorting indices, for more information about sorting
     indices.) @refill @ETC.
     ! Paragraph ended before @xref was complete.
     <to be read again>
                       @par
     l.27

     ?
     ---------- Buffer: *tex-shell* ----------

  In this case, TeX produced an accurate and understandable error
message:

     Paragraph ended before @xref was complete.

'@par' is an internal TeX command of no relevance to Texinfo.  'l.27'
means that TeX detected the problem on line 27 of the Texinfo file.  The
'?' is the prompt TeX uses in this circumstance.

  Unfortunately, TeX is not always so helpful, and sometimes you must
truly be a Sherlock Holmes to discover what went wrong.

  In any case, if you run into a problem like this, you can do one of
three things.

  1. You can tell TeX to continue running and ignore just this error by
     typing <RET> at the '?' prompt.

  2. You can tell TeX to continue running and to ignore all errors as
     best it can by typing 'r <RET>' at the '?' prompt.

     This is often the best thing to do.  However, beware: the one error
     may produce a cascade of additional error messages as its
     consequences are felt through the rest of the file.  To stop TeX
     when it is producing such an avalanche of error messages, type
     'C-c' (or 'C-c C-c', if you are running a shell inside Emacs).

  3. You can tell TeX to stop this run by typing 'x <RET>' at the '?'
     prompt.

  If you are running TeX inside Emacs, you need to switch to the shell
buffer and line at which TeX offers the '?' prompt.

  Sometimes TeX will format a file without producing error messages even
though there is a problem.  This usually occurs if a command is not
ended but TeX is able to continue processing anyhow.  For example, if
you fail to end an itemized list with the '@end itemize' command, TeX
will write a DVI file that you can print out.  The only error message
that TeX will give you is the somewhat mysterious comment:

     (@end occurred inside a group at level 1)

However, if you print the DVI file, you will find that the text of the
file that follows the itemized list is entirely indented as if it were
part of the last item in the itemized list.  The error message is the
way TeX says that it expected to find an '@end' command somewhere in the
file; but that it could not determine where it was needed.

  Another source of notoriously hard-to-find errors is a missing '@end
group' command.  If you ever are stumped by incomprehensible errors,
look for a missing '@end group' command first.

  If the Texinfo file lacks header lines, TeX may stop in the beginning
of its run and display output that looks like the following.  The '*'
indicates that TeX is waiting for input.

     This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2c 7.0)
     (test.texinfo [1])
     *

In this case, simply type '\end <RET>' after the asterisk.  Then write
the header lines in the Texinfo file and run the TeX command again.
(Note the use of the backslash, '\'.  TeX uses '\' instead of '@'; and
in this circumstance, you are working directly with TeX, not with
Texinfo.)

E.4 Using 'texinfo-show-structure'
==================================

It is not always easy to keep track of the nodes, chapters, sections,
and subsections of a Texinfo file.  This is especially true if you are
revising or adding to a Texinfo file that someone else has written.

  In GNU Emacs, in Texinfo mode, the 'texinfo-show-structure' command
lists all the lines that begin with the @-commands that specify the
structure: '@chapter', '@section', '@appendix', and so on.  With an
argument ('C-u' as prefix argument, if interactive), the command also
shows the '@node' lines.  The 'texinfo-show-structure' command is bound
to 'C-c C-s' in Texinfo mode, by default.

  The lines are displayed in a buffer called the '*Occur*' buffer,
indented by hierarchical level.  For example, here is a part of what was
produced by running 'texinfo-show-structure' on this manual:

     Lines matching "^@\\(chapter \\|sect\\|subs\\|subh\\|
     unnum\\|major\\|chapheading \\|heading \\|appendix\\)"
     in buffer texinfo.texi.
     ...
     4177:@chapter Nodes
     4198:    @heading Two Paths
     4231:    @section Node and Menu Illustration
     4337:    @section The @code{@@node} Command
     4393:        @subheading Choosing Node and Pointer Names
     4417:        @subsection How to Write an @code{@@node} Line
     4469:        @subsection @code{@@node} Line Tips
     ...

  This says that lines 4337, 4393, and 4417 of 'texinfo.texi' begin with
the '@section', '@subheading', and '@subsection' commands respectively.
If you move your cursor into the '*Occur*' window, you can position the
cursor over one of the lines and use the 'C-c C-c' command
('occur-mode-goto-occurrence'), to jump to the corresponding spot in the
Texinfo file.  *Note Using Occur: (emacs)Other Repeating Search, for
more information about 'occur-mode-goto-occurrence'.

  The first line in the '*Occur*' window describes the "regular
expression" specified by TEXINFO-HEADING-PATTERN.  This regular
expression is the pattern that 'texinfo-show-structure' looks for.
*Note Using Regular Expressions: (emacs)Regexps, for more information.

  When you invoke the 'texinfo-show-structure' command, Emacs will
display the structure of the whole buffer.  If you want to see the
structure of just a part of the buffer, of one chapter, for example, use
the 'C-x n n' ('narrow-to-region') command to mark the region.  (*Note
(emacs)Narrowing::.)  This is how the example used above was generated.
(To see the whole buffer again, use 'C-x n w' ('widen').)

  If you call 'texinfo-show-structure' with a prefix argument by typing
'C-u C-c C-s', it will list lines beginning with '@node' as well as the
lines beginning with the @-sign commands for '@chapter', '@section', and
the like.

  You can remind yourself of the structure of a Texinfo file by looking
at the list in the '*Occur*' window; and if you have mis-named a node or
left out a section, you can correct the mistake.

E.5 Using 'occur'
=================

Sometimes the 'texinfo-show-structure' command produces too much
information.  Perhaps you want to remind yourself of the overall
structure of a Texinfo file, and are overwhelmed by the detailed list
produced by 'texinfo-show-structure'.  In this case, you can use the
'occur' command directly.  To do this, type:

     M-x occur

and then, when prompted, type a "regexp", a regular expression for the
pattern you want to match.  (*Note Regular Expressions: (emacs)Regexps.)
The 'occur' command works from the current location of the cursor in the
buffer to the end of the buffer.  If you want to run 'occur' on the
whole buffer, place the cursor at the beginning of the buffer.

  For example, to see all the lines that contain the word '@chapter' in
them, just type '@chapter'.  This will produce a list of the chapters.
It will also list all the sentences with '@chapter' in the middle of the
line.

  If you want to see only those lines that start with the word
'@chapter', type '^@chapter' when prompted by 'occur'.  If you want to
see all the lines that end with a word or phrase, end the last word with
a '$'; for example, 'catching mistakes$'.  This can be helpful when you
want to see all the nodes that are part of the same chapter or section
and therefore have the same 'Up' pointer.

  *Note Using Occur: (emacs)Other Repeating Search, for more
information.

E.6 Finding Badly Referenced Nodes
==================================

You can use the 'Info-validate' command to check whether any of the
'Next', 'Previous', 'Up' or other node pointers fail to point to a node.
This command checks that every node pointer points to an existing node.
The 'Info-validate' command works only on Info files, not on Texinfo
files.

  The 'makeinfo' program validates pointers automatically, so you do not
need to use the 'Info-validate' command if you are using 'makeinfo'.
You only may need to use 'Info-validate' if you are unable to run
'makeinfo' and instead must create an Info file using
'texinfo-format-region' or 'texinfo-format-buffer', or if you write an
Info file from scratch.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Using Info-validate,  Next: Unsplit,  Up: Running Info-validate

E.6.1 Using 'Info-validate'
---------------------------

To use 'Info-validate', visit the Info file you wish to check and type:

     M-x Info-validate

Note that the 'Info-validate' command requires an uppercase 'I'.  You
may also need to create a tag table before running 'Info-validate'.
*Note Tagifying::.

  If your file is valid, you will receive a message that says "File
appears valid".  However, if you have a pointer that does not point to a
node, error messages will be displayed in a buffer called '*problems in
info file*'.

  For example, 'Info-validate' was run on a test file that contained
only the first node of this manual.  One of the messages said:

     In node "Overview", invalid Next: Texinfo Mode

This meant that the node called 'Overview' had a 'Next' pointer that did
not point to anything (which was true in this case, since the test file
had only one node in it).

  Now suppose we add a node named 'Texinfo Mode' to our test case but we
do not specify a 'Previous' for this node.  Then we will get the
following error message:

     In node "Texinfo Mode", should have Previous: Overview

This is because every 'Next' pointer should be matched by a 'Previous'
(in the node where the 'Next' points) which points back.

  'Info-validate' also checks that all menu entries and cross references
point to actual nodes.

  'Info-validate' requires a tag table and does not work with files that
have been split.  (The 'texinfo-format-buffer' command automatically
splits large files.)  In order to use 'Info-validate' on a large file,
you must run 'texinfo-format-buffer' with an argument so that it does
not split the Info file; and you must create a tag table for the unsplit
file.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Unsplit,  Next: Tagifying,  Prev: Using Info-validate,  Up: Running Info-validate

E.6.2 Creating an Unsplit File
------------------------------

You can run 'Info-validate' only on a single Info file that has a tag
table.  The command will not work on the indirect subfiles that are
generated when a master file is split.  If you have a large file (longer
than 300,000 bytes or so), you need to run the 'texinfo-format-buffer'
or 'makeinfo-buffer' command in such a way that it does not create
indirect subfiles.  You will also need to create a tag table for the
Info file.  After you have done this, you can run 'Info-validate' and
look for badly referenced nodes.

  The first step is to create an unsplit Info file.  To prevent
'texinfo-format-buffer' from splitting a Texinfo file into smaller Info
files, give a prefix to the 'M-x texinfo-format-buffer' command:

     C-u M-x texinfo-format-buffer

or else

     C-u C-c C-e C-b

When you do this, Texinfo will not split the file and will not create a
tag table for it.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Tagifying,  Next: Splitting,  Prev: Unsplit,  Up: Running Info-validate

E.6.3 Tagifying a File
----------------------

After creating an unsplit Info file, you must create a tag table for it.
Visit the Info file you wish to tagify and type:

     M-x Info-tagify

(Note the uppercase 'I' in 'Info-tagify'.)  This creates an Info file
with a tag table that you can validate.

  The third step is to validate the Info file:

     M-x Info-validate

(Note the uppercase 'I' in 'Info-validate'.)  In brief, the steps are:

     C-u M-x texinfo-format-buffer
     M-x Info-tagify
     M-x Info-validate

  After you have validated the node structure, you can rerun
'texinfo-format-buffer' in the normal way so it will construct a tag
table and split the file automatically, or you can make the tag table
and split the file manually.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Splitting,  Prev: Tagifying,  Up: Running Info-validate

E.6.4 Splitting a File Manually
-------------------------------

You should split a large file or else let the 'texinfo-format-buffer' or
'makeinfo-buffer' command do it for you automatically.  (Generally you
will let one of the formatting commands do this job for you.  *Note
Creating an Info File::.)

  The split-off files are called the indirect subfiles.

  Info files are split to save memory.  With smaller files, Emacs does
not have make such a large buffer to hold the information.

  If an Info file has more than 30 nodes, you should also make a tag
table for it.  *Note Using Info-validate::, for information about
creating a tag table.  (Again, tag tables are usually created
automatically by the formatting command; you only need to create a tag
table yourself if you are doing the job manually.  Most likely, you will
do this for a large, unsplit file on which you have run
'Info-validate'.)

  Visit the Info file you wish to tagify and split and type the two
commands:

     M-x Info-tagify
     M-x Info-split

(Note that the 'I' in 'Info' is uppercase.)

  When you use the 'Info-split' command, the buffer is modified into a
(small) Info file which lists the indirect subfiles.  This file should
be saved in place of the original visited file.  The indirect subfiles
are written in the same directory the original file is in, with names
generated by appending '-' and a number to the original file name.

  The primary file still functions as an Info file, but it contains just
the tag table and a directory of subfiles.

Appendix F Info Format Specification
************************************

Here we describe the technical details of the Info format.

  This format definition was written some 25 years after the Info format
was first devised.  So in the event of conflicts between this definition
and actual practice, practice wins.  It also assumes some general
knowledge of Texinfo; it is meant to be a guide for implementors rather
than a rigid technical standard.  We often refer back to other parts of
this manual for examples and definitions, rather than redundantly
spelling out every detail.

  In this formal description, the characters '<>*()|=#' are used for the
language of the description itself.  Other characters are literal.  The
formal constructs used are typical: '<...>' indicates a metavariable
name, '=' means definition, '*' repetition, '?' optional, '()' grouping,
'|' alternation, '#' comment.  Exception: '*' at the beginning of a line
is literal.

  We specify literal parentheses (those that are part of the Info
format) with <lparen> and <rparen>, meaning the single characters '('
and ')' respectively.

  Finally, the two-character sequence '^X' means the single character
'CTRL-X', for any X.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Whole Manual,  Next: Info Format Preamble,  Up: Info Format General Layout

Info Format: A Whole Manual
---------------------------

To begin, an Info manual is either "nonsplit" (contained wholly within a
single file) or "split" (across several files).

  The syntax for a nonsplit manual is:

         <nonsplit info file> =
     <preamble>
     <node>*
     <tag table>
     (<local variables>)?

  When split, there is a "main file", which contains only pointers to
the nodes given in other "subfiles".  The main file looks like this:

         <split info main file> =
     <preamble>
     <indirect table>
     <tag table>
     (<local variables>)?

  The subfiles in a split manual have the following syntax:

         <split info subfile> =
     <preamble>
     <node>*


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Preamble,  Next: Info Format Indirect Tag Table,  Prev: Info Format Whole Manual,  Up: Info Format General Layout

Info Format: Preamble
---------------------

The <preamble> is text at the beginning of all output files.  It is not
intended to be visible by default in an Info viewer, but may be
displayed upon user request.

         <preamble> =
     <identification>       # "This is FILENAME, produced by ..."
     <copying text>         # Expansion of @copying text.
     <dir entries>          # Derived from @dircategory and @direntry.

  These pieces are:

<identification line>
     An arbitrary string beginning the output file, followed by a blank
     line.

<copying text>
     The expansion of an '@copying' environment, if the manual has one
     (*note @copying::).

<dir entries>
     The result of any '@dircategory' and '@direntry' commands present
     in the manual (*note Installing Dir Entries::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Indirect Tag Table,  Next: Info Format Tag Table,  Prev: Info Format Preamble,  Up: Info Format General Layout

Info Format: Indirect Tag Table
-------------------------------

The indirect table is written to the main file in the case of split
output only.  It specifies the starting byte position of each split
output file (as a decimal integer):

         <indirect table> =
     ^_
     Indirect:
     (<filename>: <bytepos>)*

  The number of preamble bytes written to each output file is included
in the positions.  Neither the preamble nor the size of the top-level
output file is included.

  The first actual node of content will be pointed to by the first
entry.

  Unfortunately, Info-creating programs such as 'makeinfo' have not
always implemented these rules perfectly, due to various bugs and
oversights.  Therefore, robust Info viewers should fall back to
searching "nearby" the given position for a node, instead of just giving
up if the position is not perfectly at a node beginning.

  As an example, suppose split output is generated for the GDB manual.
The top-level file 'gdb.info' will contain something like this:

     ^_
     Indirect:
     gdb.info-1: 1878
     gdb.info-2: 295733
     ...

  This tells Info viewers that the first node of the manual occurs at
byte 1878 (i.e., after the preamble) of the file 'gdb.info-1'.  The
first node written to 'gdb.info-2' would start at byte 295733 if the
subsequent 'gdb.info-*' files (not including 'gdb.info' files were
appended to 'gdb.info-1', including their preambles.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Tag Table,  Next: Info Format Local Variables,  Prev: Info Format Indirect Tag Table,  Up: Info Format General Layout

Info Format: Tag Table
----------------------

The tag table specifies the starting byte position of each node and
anchor in the file.  It is written in the main output file only, not (in
the case of split output) any subfiles.

         <tag table> =
     ^_
     Tag Table:
     <lparen>Indirect<rparen> # this line appears in split output only
     (Node|Ref): <nodeid>^?<bytepos>
     ^_
     End Tag Table

  The '(Indirect)' line is the next line after 'Tag Table:' in the case
of split output only.

  Each following line defines an identifier as either an anchor or a
node, as specific.  It is an error to define the same identifier both
ways.  For example, 'Node: Top^?1647' says that the node named 'Top'
starts at byte 1647 while 'Ref: Overview-Footnote-1^?30045' says that
the anchor named 'Overview-Footnote-1' starts at byte 30045.

  In the case of nonsplit output, the byte positions simply refer to the
location in the output file.  In the case of split output, the byte
positions refer to an imaginary file created by concatenating all the
split files (but not the top-level file).  See the previous section.

  Here is an example:

     ^_
     Tag Table:
     Node: Top^_89
     Node: Ch1^_292
     ^_
     End Tag Table

  This specifies a manual with two nodes, 'Top' and 'Ch1', at byte
positions 89 and 292 respectively.  Because the '(Indirect)' line is not
present, the manual is not split.

Info Format: Local Variables
----------------------------

The local variables section is optional and is currently used to give
the encoding information.  It may be augmented in the future.

         <local variables> =
     ^_
     Local Variables:
     coding: <encoding>
     End:

  *Note @documentencoding::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Regular Nodes,  Prev: Info Format Local Variables,  Up: Info Format General Layout

Info Format: Regular Nodes
--------------------------

Regular nodes look like this:

         <node> =
     ^_
     File: <fn>, Node: <id1>, (Next: <id2>, )? (Prev: <id3>, )? Up: <id4>

     <general text, until the next ^_ or end-of-file>

  The 'Next' and 'Prev' pointers are optional.  The 'Up' pointer may
technically also be absent, although this is most likely the case of a
wrongly-structured Info manual.  At least one space must be present
after each colon and comma, but any number of spaces are ignored.

  This <node> defines <id1> in file <fn>, which is typically just
'manualname' or perhaps 'manualname.info'.  Each of the other references
<id2>, <id3>, and <id4> must be defined with either 'Node' or 'Ref' in
the <tag table>.

  Conventionally the nodes are arranged to form a tree, but this is not
a requirement of the format.  Each pointer can refer to any defined
identifier.

  Identifiers cannot include periods, commas, colons or parentheses
(including @-commands which produce any of these); these can confuse
Info readers.  *Note Node Line Requirements::.

  The <general text> of the node can include the special constructs
described next.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Text Constructs,  Prev: Info Format General Layout,  Up: Info Format Specification

F.2 Info Format Text Constructs
===============================

These special Info constructs can appear within the text of a node.

* Menu:

* Menu:  Info Format Menu.
* Image: Info Format Image.
* Printindex: Info Format Printindex.
* Xref:  Info Format Cross Reference.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Menu,  Next: Info Format Image,  Up: Info Format Text Constructs

F.2.1 Info Format: Menu
-----------------------

Conventionally menus appear at the end of nodes, but the Info format
places no restrictions on their location.

         <menu> =
     * Menu:
     (<menu entry> | <menu comment>)*

  The parts of a <menu entry> are described in *note Menu Parts::.

  A <menu comment> is any line not beginning with '*' that appears
either at the beginning of the menu or is separated from a menu entry by
one or more blank lines.  These comments are intended to be displayed as
part of the menu, as-is (*note Writing a Menu::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Image,  Next: Info Format Printindex,  Prev: Info Format Menu,  Up: Info Format Text Constructs

F.2.2 Info Format: Image
------------------------

The '@image' command results in the following special directive within
the Info file (*note Images::):

         <image> =
     ^@^H[image src="<image file>"
                 (text="<txt file contents>")?
                 (alt="<alt text>")?
     ^@^H]

  The line breaks and indentation in this description are editorial; the
whitespace between the different parts of the directive in Info files is
arbitrary.

  In the string <image file>, <txt file contents> and <alt text>, '"' is
quoted as '\"' and '\' is quoted as '\\'.  The text and alt
specifications are optional.

  The alt value serves the same purpose as in HTML: A prose description
of the image.  In text-only displays or speech systems, for example, the
alt value may be used instead of displaying the (typically graphical)
<image file>.

  The <txt file contents>, if present, should be taken as an ASCII
representation of the image, and also may be used on a text-only
display.

  The format does not prescribe the choice between displaying the <image
file>, the <alt text> or <txt file contents>.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Printindex,  Next: Info Format Cross Reference,  Prev: Info Format Image,  Up: Info Format Text Constructs

F.2.3 Info Format: Printindex
-----------------------------

Indices in Info format are generally written as a menu (*note
Indices::), but with an additional directive at the beginning marking
this as an index node:

         <printindex> =
     ^@^H[index^@^H]
     * Menu:

     <index entry>*

  The <index entry> items are similar to normal menu entries, but the
free-format description is replaced by the line number of where the
entries occurs in the text:

         <index entry> =
     * <entry text>: <entry node>. <lparen>line <lineno><rparen>

The <entry text> is the index term.  The <lineno> is an unsigned
integer, given relative to the start of the <entry node>.  There may be
arbitrary whitespace after the colon and period, as usual in menus.
Here is an example:

     ^@^H[index^@^H]
     * Menu:

     * thunder:           Weather Phenomena.             (line 5)

  This means that an index entry for 'thunder' appears at line 5 of the
node 'Weather Phenomena'.

F.2.4 Info Format: Cross Reference
----------------------------------

A general cross reference in Info format is written as follows:

         <cross-reference> =
     * (N|n)ote (<id>:: | <label>:(<lparen><infofile><rparen>)?<id>(.|,))

  Whether 'note' or 'Note' is used is not significant.

  The '<id>::' form indicates a node or anchor reference within the
current manual.

  The longer form indicates a general reference, typically used to refer
to a node or anchor in a different manual, but possibly to the current
manual.  The <label> is descriptive text; the optional '(<infofile>)' is
the filename of the manual being referenced, and the <id> is the node or
anchor within that manual, terminated by a comma or period.  That final
punctuation is part of the surrounding sentence, and should be
displayed.

  Here are some examples:

     *note GNU Free Documentation License::
     *note Tag table: Info Format Tag Table, for details.
     *Note Overview: (make)Top.

  The first shows the short form, a reference to a node in the current
manual.

  The second also refers to a node in the current manual, namely 'Info
Format Tag Table'; the 'Tag table' before the ':' is only a label on
this particular reference.

  The third example refers to the node 'Top' in another manual, namely
'make', with 'Overview' being the label for this cross reference.

  *Note Cross References::.

*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

  If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

  If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

  If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
