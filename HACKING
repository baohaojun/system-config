This file is about hacking beagle, the predecessor of beagrep, and
thus should be considered outdated.

Subversion
----------

Beagrep's source repository is in GNOME subversion, in the module 'beagrep'.

For information on GNOME svn, see:
http://developer.gnome.org/tools/svn.html.


Patches
-------

If you have a patch you'd like to submit, please open a tracking bug on
bugzilla.gnome.org (product 'beagrep').  Attach the patch (and any additional
required files) to the bug.  The core developers are all on the beagrep-bugs
mailing list, so we'll see that it is there.  We will review it, but if people
are busy it might not happen right away.  

In the past we'd been doing patch review on the mailing list, but that hasn't
always worked very well.  Sometimes patches get lost in the shuffle.


Organization
------------

Code that parses files or otherwise interacts w/ low-level details from
third-party apps (i.e. parsing gaim logs, undocumented nautilus metafiles and
stuff from .gnome2/epiphany, etc.) should probably be broken out into small
chunks of semi-independent code and placed in Beagrep/Util.  That kind of code
is just ugly by nature, and I want to keep it from getting mixed into the
beagrep code as much as possible.

Anything in Util that requires gtk+ or gnome should be added to the UiUtil.dll
assembly.  Otherwise, add it to the Util.dll assembly.


Coding Style
------------

Beagrep attempts to follow the Mono coding conventions.  The following
description of those conventions was shamelessly stolen from Dashboard's
HACKING file.

* Tagging buggy code

        If there is a bug in your implementation tag the problem by using
        the word "FIXME" in the code, together with a description of the 
        problem.

        Do not use XXX or TODO or obscure descriptions, because
        otherwise people will not be able to understand what you mean.


* Basic code formatting

        In order to keep the code consistent, please use the following
        conventions.  From here on `good' and `bad' are used to attribute
        things that would make the coding style match, or not match.  It is not
        a judgement call on your coding abilities, but more of a style and 
        look call.  Please follow these guidelines to ensure prettiness.

        Use 8 space tabs for writing your code.

        Since we are using 8-space tabs, you might want to consider the Linus
        Torvalds trick to reduce code nesting.  Many times in a loop, you will
        find yourself doing a test, and if the test is true, you will
        nest.  Many times this can be changed.  Example:


                for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                        if (Something (i)) {
                                DoMore ();
                        }
                }

        This take precious space, instead write it like this:

                for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                        if (! Something (i))
                                continue;
                        DoMore ();
                }

        A few guidelines:

                * Use a space before an opening parenthesis when calling
                  functions, or indexing, like this:

                        Method (a);
                        b [10];

                * Do not put a space after the opening parenthesis and the 
                  closing one, ie:

                        good: Method (a);       array [10];

                        bad:  Method ( a );     array[ 10 ];

                * Inside a code block, put the opening brace on the same line
                  as the statement:

                        good:
                                if (a) {
                                        Code ();
                                        Code ();
                                }

                        bad:
                                if (a) 
                                {
                                        Code ();
                                        Code ();
                                }

                * Avoid using unnecessary open/close braces, vertical space
                  is usually limited:

                        good:
                                if (a)
                                        Code ();

                        bad:
                                if (a) {
                                        Code ();
                                }

		* However, when defining loops where the subpart could be
		  considered one statement, use open/close braces for
		  clarity.  For example:

			good:
				while (true) {
					if (a)
					        foo = true;
				}

			bad:
				while (true)
					if (a)
					        foo = true;


                * When defining a method, use the C style for brace placement, 
                  that means, use a new line for the brace, like this:

                        good:
                                void Method ()
                                {
                                }

                        bad:
                                void Method () {
                                }

                * Properties and indexers are an exception, keep the
                  brace on the same line as the property declaration.
                  Rationale: this makes it visually
                  simple to distinguish them.

                        good:
                                int Property {
                                        get {
                                                return value;
                                        }
                                }

                        bad:
                                int Property 
                                {
                                        get {
                                                return value;
                                        }
                                }

                  Notice how the accessor "get" also keeps its brace on the same
                  line.

                  For very small properties, you can compress things:

                        ok:
                                int Property {
                                        get { return value; }
                                        set { x = value; }
                                }

                * Use white space in expressions liberally, except in the presence
                  of parenthesis:

                        good:

                                if (a + 5 > Method (Blah () + 4))

                        bad:
                                if (a+5>Method(Blah()+4))

		* This also applies for "for" loops:

			good:
				for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)

			bad:
				for (int i=0;i<100;i++)

		* Please also use spaces and clear language (capitalization,
                  punctuation) in comments:

			good:
				// It's going to crash if we're not careful.

			bad:
				//its going to crash if were not careful

                * For any new files, please use a descriptive introduction, like
                  this:

                        //
                        // System.Comment.cs: Handles comments in System files.
                        //
                        // Copyright (C) 2002 Address, Inc. (http://www.address.com)
                        //

		* Also remember to include the license in comments at the top of
                  the file.  Cut-and-paste this out of other source files in the
                  tree.

                * Switch statements have the case at the same indentation as the
                  switch:

                        switch (x) {
                        case 'a':
                                ...
                        case 'b':
                                ...
                        }

		* Large switch statements should have blank lines
		  between case statements:
			 
			 switch (x) {

			 case 'a':
				large code chunk;

			 case 'b':
				another code chunk;

			 default:
				another code chunk;
			 }

		* All method names and properties should be StudlyCapped.

		* Private variable members of a class and function
		  local variable names should be under_scored (no
		  camelCase please).

		* C# is a pretty verbose and heavily-nested language.  Don't
                  worry about trying to fit everything into 80 columns.
                  However, don't be afraid to use multiple lines, especially
                  with function arguments when it may be easier to read or
                  more aesthetic to do so.
		  
		  If you are splitting a function declaration into multiple
		  lines, the arguments should be aligned to match the
		  opening brace:

			void Function (int arg1, bool arg2,
				       bool arg3)
			{
			}

		  If you are splitting a function invokation, the overflowed
		  lines begin at the next tabbed position:

			MyFunction ("Very long argument 1",
				"Next argument begins at next tab",
				"And so on");

* Best practices

	* Use String.Empty instead of "" for any comparisons.  This is
	  because using "" will cause a new string to be allocated,
	  whereas String.Empty is an interned reference.

	* Instead of comparing strings against both null and "" or
	  String.Empty, use String.IsNullOrEmpty().  This function
	  was added in .NET 2.0, so large portions of the code
	  don't use this yet.

If you are using Emacs, you might want to put something like this
in your .emacs file:

(defun poor-mans-csharp-mode ()
  (java-mode)
  (setq mode-name "C#")
  (set-variable 'tab-width 8)
  (set-variable 'indent-tabs-mode t)
  (set-variable 'c-basic-offset 8)
  (c-set-offset 'inline-open 0)
  (c-set-offset 'case-label 0)
)

(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.cs\\'" . poor-mans-csharp-mode))
			      auto-mode-alist))
