#+title: Android App development under FreeBSD
# bhj-tags: android
I started using FreeBSD around May 2020. Don't know why, maybe just got a bit tired with Linux, and needed something new (I've been using Linux for ~15 years, at 10th year, I made a video about [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp2b3-Guej0][my Linux daily usage]]).

So far I'm quite happy about FreeBSD experience. At one point, it was painful and I asked myself why are you doing this, man? I was about to give up, but then I take a deep breath and tried again, since deep down my heart I kind of know why I'm painful: it's because I mixed the FreeBSD Quarterly version and the Latest version. The second time, I sticked with Quarterly.

All in all, FreeBSD is very stable! I loved it when I found the laptop (ThinkPad T440p) can sleep and wakeup reliably -- on the other hand, X Window on Linux often fail to wake up, forcing me to restart the desktop session and losing all the open windows.

** Android App development under FreeBSD

Android App development under FreeBSD is very painful, but not impossible. After a lot of Googling, I have come through a relatively smooth method.

TL;DR:

1. Install Linux Binary Compatibility
2. Install Linux version of Android Studio, make it run with LBC

   Need decompile and recompile a certain Android jar file.
3. Downgrade adb on FreeBSD
4. Updated lsp-intellij and lsp-intellij-server, so that I can use Emacs for Android App development
5. A workaround for using both Emacs (lsp-intellij) and AndroidStudio for App development

*** Install Linux Binary Compatibility

You'd better have read the LBC document, and have a basic understanding about how it works (see below).

*** Hacking android jars and android studio
 1. Find a simple Android App source code (for e.g., copy from a Linux system).

 2. Get the android sdk downloaded through gradle (by running =./gradlew aR=), then it fails, complaining about unknown platform: FreeBSD

 3. patch the sdk common.jar (=find ~/.gradle/ -name 'common*.jar'|grep android=) according to http://zewaren.net/android-1.html, but with jd-gui:

    - open the jar file with jd-gui
    - save the SdkConstants.java to ~/
    - javac ~/SdkConstants.java -cp $(find ~/.gradle/ -name 'common*.jar'|grep android)
    - mkdir com/android -p;
    - mv ~/SdkConstants.class ./com/android/;
    - jar uf $(find ~/.gradle/ -name 'common*.jar'|grep android) com/android/SdkConstants.class

 4. Work around an mkdir error in aapt2:

    - =sudo ln -s /home/ /compat/linux/home=

    This is found out through running aapt2 with truss: aapt2 will =mkdir("/home")= and fail, so, I just desparately made a symlink for it.

    =/compat/linux= has a filesystem union for linux binaries, but, sometimes the union seems to be broken, for e.g., if you run this command:

    ~PATH=/compat/linux/bin:/compat/linux/usr/bin/:$PATH bash -c 'ls /dev'~

    You will see nothing except =/dev/shm=. But if you run:

    ~PATH=/compat/linux/bin:/compat/linux/usr/bin/:$PATH bash -c 'ls /dev/null'~

    Then, you can see that =/dev/null= is output. This is confusing for some programs: If you =ls /dev=, =/dev/null= is not there; but if you =ls /dev/null=, it is there! The reason aapt2 try to mkdir("/home") is kind of like that too, I think.

 5. run =linux-env ./gradlew aR= again, and this time, it works.

    =linux-env= is a simple script I wrote:

    #+begin_src sh
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      set -e

      PATH=/compat/linux/bin:$PATH
      "$@"
    #+end_src

 6. Now, I can also run AndroidStudio, can generate an Android App Project.

    - export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/openjdk8/
    - Gradle sync will fail, complaining:

          > Process 'command '/home/bhj/android-studio/jre/bin/java'' finished with non-zero exit value 1

      To fix this, inside AndroidStudio, set the jre that gradle uses to the same as /usr/local/openjdk8.

    Then, gradle will fail again, complaining =Unknown platform 'FreeBSD'=. But we already know how to fix this: start AndroidStudio with =linux-env ~/android-studio/bin/studio.sh=.

*** Fix adb devices go missing

Here the problem is that my phone's adb connection will suddenly be gone when doing adb push or adb install.

When I'm using android-studio and then later running adb push, I find the adb device will be gone all at once.

But another tool that I'm using, won't make adb device disappear. The tool's C++ adb code is copied from adb version 1.0.39, and the current adb(1) version I'm using is 1.0.41, so I doubted that maybe it's because of the higher adb version is not compatible with my phone.

In other words:

- If I use the adb binary directly, that is, 1.0.41 adb client with 1.0.41 adb server (adb fork-server), adb push will disconnect my adb.
- If I use 1.0.39 adb client with 1.0.41 adb server, adb push won't disconnect my adb.

Seems the bug must be in the adb 1.0.41 client/server protocol, so I decided to downgrade my adb binary.

After some googling, I found that I can install older version of adb with portdowngrade, so I googled for freebsd's adb port revision for adb-1.0.39, and downgraded it. One problem when compiling: I must replace android_pubkey.c with current version to fix a build error:

 #+begin_src sh
   sudo cp \
        /usr/ports/devel/android-tools-adb/work/platform_system_core-platform-tools-29.0.4/libcrypto_utils/android_pubkey.c \
        /usr/ports/adb-1.0.39/android-tools-adb/work/platform_system_core-android-8.1.0_r2/adb/../libcrypto_utils/android_pubkey.c

 #+end_src

After that, my adb device connection is quite stable now.

*** Update lsp-intellij and lsp-intellij-server

I use Emacs for almost everything.

There is a project [[https://github.com/Ruin0x11/lsp-intellij][lsp-intellij]] that allow me to use Emacs together with AndroidStudio (which is based on [[https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/products/android_studio.html][Intellij]]), but it has long been unmaintained: it supported lsp-mode version
4.1, and can't be used in current version anymore.

I verified using old version of everything (thanks to github!), and saw that lsp-intellij does work in that version. That gave me confidence to make it work under current version of lsp-mode (6.2.1).

It's very dirty for now, but it does work (auto-completion, syntax error hint, etc). Maybe I will clean it up later.

*** Work around for using both AndroidStudio and Emacs

Once I start lsp, the AndroidStudio window for the App project will be hidden -- I can't open it again, unless I kill AndroidStudio and restart it, but then, I can't use lsp in Emacs unless I restart lsp, which will close the AndroidStudio window.

Lsp-intellij just formid you to edit a single file in parallel.

For now, I can only think of a workaround for this:

1. Copy the project files with a hardlink:

   #+begin_src sh
     cp AppProject AppProject.shadow -avl
   #+end_src

2. Open AppProject.shadow in AndroidStudio

3. When I need to import a class, for e.g., this is not supported by lsp-intellij, so I switch to the AndroidStudio AppProject.shadow, and do the import there, then I switch back to Emacs.
