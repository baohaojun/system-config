#+title: Using Emacs as a better Source Insight
# bhj-tags: emacs
I wrote an article about using Emacs and its free software friends for
[[../../../2012/10/11/reading-source-code-cn.org][code reading]], but it is all in Chinese. So here I will show you how I
used Emacs as a better +Source Insight+, in English😊

* Use grep-mode relentlessly

For most functions of source insight, we need only 1 function in
Emacs, and that is grep-mode. Need search for definition of a
function? Use grep-mode. Need search for where a function is called?
Use grep-mode. You just need several very different, very fast GREP(1)
commands. In my setup, there are a couple of them: =beagrep=, =gtags=,
=ctags-exuberant=, =grep-gtags=, =grep-func-call=,
=grep-func-call-all=.

** Grepping for something random
Here's the result of using beagrep for searching where something
occurs. This is very slow in +Source Insight+, and especially if the
project is very large (for e.g., the whole Android project), +Source
Insight+ will melt down. But I can grep a very familiar string
=("hello world\n")= in 9 gigabytes of Android source code in one third
of a second. Here's the result:

#+BEGIN_SRC grepout
-*- mode: grep; default-directory: "~/src/android/external/chromium_org/tools/gyp/test/make/" -*-

beagrep -e "(\"hello world\\\\n\")"
/home/bhj/src/android/external/chromium_org/tools/gyp/test/make/main.cc:10:  printf("hello world\n");
/home/bhj/src/android/external/clang/bindings/python/tests/cindex/INPUTS/hello.cpp:4:    printf("hello world\n");
/home/bhj/src/android/external/clang/www/get_started.html:213:int main(int argc, char **argv) { printf("hello world\n"); }

Beagrep source code is [[https://github.com/baohaojun/beagrep][here]] and blog is [[../../../2011/12/23/beagrep.org][here]].

Note how I didn't use a screenshot for the above grep output! I
customized my org-mode setup so that grep-mode and compilation-mode
can be htmlized too😝

Also note how I put 4 backslashes before the n to grep the newline
character =\n= in C. This is automatic, I wrote some Emacs Lisp for
grep-mode, so that the correct grep rege😛 can be generated
automatically.

** Grepping for definitions
Here's how to grep for a function definition:

#+BEGIN_SRC grepout
-*- mode: grep; default-directory: "~/src/android/" -*-
Grep started at Wed Aug 20 09:33:29

grep-gtags -e "getExternalStorageDirectory" -v .xml
Found total 5/13 definitions: Entering directory `/home/bhj/src/android'
frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/Environment.java:177: metho😛 <android.os.Environment.UserEnvironment.getExternalStorageDirectory> : public File getExternalStorageDirectory() {

#+END_SRC

Note how I hacked grep-mode to show some respect to the =Entering
directory `/home/bhj/src/android'#= thing, which used to be for
compilation-mode only😊 I did this so that the grep output can be a
bit shorter: instead of
=/home/bhj/src/android/frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/Environment.java:177:=,
I need only start with =frameworks/=.

=grep-gtags= is a shell/perl script that I wrote which integrated
=ctags-exuberant= and =gtags= from GNU global. You may want to check
out Ajoke.el which is a package for doing Java completion in Emacs
(code [[https://github.com/baohaojun/ajoke][here]] and blog [[../../../2013/10/01/0-Inside-Ajoke.org][here]]).

** Grepping for where a definition is used

I use =grep-func-call-all= and =grep-func-call= for finding out how a
function/variable/class etc. is used.

Here's an example:

#+BEGIN_SRC grepout
-*- mode: grep; default-directory: "~/src/android/" -*-

grep-func-call -e "ACTION_MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE" --nc -a

Here's how it works. First I use beagrep (which is very fast) to find
out all the files that contain =ACTION_MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE=, then
I use =ctags-exuberant= to parse each of these files. For e.g., in the
file =FMRecordingService.java= above, =ctags-exuberant= tells me
😛rivate Uri addToMediaDB(File file) {= appears on line 391 and
beagrep tells me that =ACTION_MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE= is on line 431
in this file, and =ctags-exuberant= also tells me that there is no
other function definition in between line 391 and 431, so I can safely
assume that =ACTION_MEDIA_SCANNER_SCAN_FILE= is called by (actually
used by, because it's not a callable thing but you know what I
mean😊​) =addToMediaDB=.

* Use sawfish to customize more key binding

I don't know why I don't do it in Emacs itself. Anyway, I have
customized my sawfish desktop so that when I press =F1=, it will
synthesize some events to the focused window (i.e. Emacs):

[[../../../../images/sawfish-binding-for-f1.png][sawfish-binding-for-f1.png]]

And the synthesized keys will invoke =grep-func-call= for me in Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC sawfish
(bind-keys global-keymap "F1" '(synthesize-multiple-events "ESC" "g" "f" "RET"))
#+END_SRC

I used the =ScrLk= key in sawfish to toggle a code reading mode for
Emacs (think =ECS/i= toggle in vim😊) so that when this mode is on, I
can press F1-F5 for all the above mentioned grepping commands, with
just a single key, so this is very convinient, just like +Source
Insight+, right?

And in the code reading mode, I can use Home/End keys to jump to the
prev/next grep result, Left/Right to back/forth where I started
grepping. The idea is from xcscope.el where the tags can be popped, I
took it a step further, that they can also be pushed. So that when
code reading, I can follow very deep down where the functions are
called one by one using =grep-func-call= again and again, and then I
can press Left key again and again to come back where I started. Then
I can use the Right key to go down the call stack again.

For e.g., here's the binding in sawfish for Home/End:

#+BEGIN_SRC sawfish
(bind-keys global-keymap "Home" '(synthesize-multiple-events "ESC" "g" "p"))
(bind-keys global-keymap "End" '(synthesize-multiple-events "ESC" "g" "n"))
#+END_SRC

And here's the help for the synthesized key in Emacs:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-g p (translated from <escape> g p) runs the command previous-error
(found in global-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function
in `simple.el'.
#+END_EXAMPLE

* How to try out my setup

I must apologize that I have not put too much thinking (actually I put
a lot but not enough) into how other people can use my setup. On
github some Emacs gurus have published a complete [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][emacs.d]] which is
well organized. My setup is one step further, I not only want to mess
with your =.emacs= and your =emacs.d=, but also your =.bashrc= and
=~/bin=, sigh...

But, in case you are not daunted by my mess, here's how to use my setup:

1. Get debian. Ubuntu will do (I tested). Maybe get a new user account
   (or back up *all* of your account's config files). Get sudo for
   your account.
2. =cd ~; git clone --recursive https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config=
3. =~/system-config/bin/Linux/after-check-out.sh=

Here's how to try out beagrep after you do the above setup:

1. =cd ~/system-config/; for-code-reading=
2. =cd ~/system-config/; beagrep -e "(\"hello world\\\\n\")" #=

Bug reports are welcome😊 Even more welcome are success stories of you using my set up😊 The most welcome is patches😊

Last but not least, can you read my emojis in this article? 😝
