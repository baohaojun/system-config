#+title: My org-mode blog for github page

Here I've written a command line blogging tool for my github [[http://baohaojun.github.io][page]].

I only need write the article in .org file, then git push it using a
special command: [[http://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/bin/git-push-rebase][=git-push-rebase=]].

This command will automatically generate the .html file and
create/update the links automatically, such as the next/previous blog
post.

I didn't use o-blog because 1) I've seen firefox complain the less.js
is run away; 2) I like generating one blog post from one .org file
(instead of 1 blog post from 1 DONE heading in a .org file); 3) The
timestamp etc. can be managed by git instead of hardcoding them in the
.org file.
