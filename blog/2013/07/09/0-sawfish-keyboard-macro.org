#+title: Simple scripts to record/play keyboard macro (sawfish)
# bhj-tags: system-config

Today I was assigned a task, to give various access permissions for
dozens of gerrit projects to a certain group. It's lots of repetitive
mouse clicking and keyboard hitting.

Then it occured to me, I cound use AutoHotKey under Windows to
automate this. But I don't want to switch to Windows, so I asked
myself, can I do it under Linux + Sawfish?

Turns out I can, and it's better than AutoHotKey: I can both record
and replay (just like under Emacs); and I can write the whole thing
myself, crystal clear in my mind!

Without further ado, here's the [[https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/bin/record-key-macro][recording script]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/bash

exec > "${1:-$HOME/.key-macro}"
function synth-key() {
    echo "$1"
    sawfish-client -e '(synthesize-event '"$1"' (input-focus))' >/dev/null 2>&1
}

while true; do
    key=$(sawfish-client -e '(event-name (read-event))')
    if test "$key" = '"Super-h"'; then
	key=$(sawfish-client -e '(event-name (read-event))')
	if test "$key" = '")"'; then
	    break
	else
	    synth-key '"Super-h"'
	    synth-key "$key"
	fi
    else
	synth-key "$key"
    fi
done
#+END_SRC

And here's the [[https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/bin/play-key-macro][playing script]]: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/bash

function synth-key() {
    echo "$1"
    sawfish-client -e '(synthesize-event '"$1"' (input-focus))' >/dev/null 2>&1
    if test "$key" = '"RET"'; then
	sleep 1
    fi
}

cat "${1:-$HOME/.key-macro}" | while read key; do
    synth-key "$key"
done      
#+END_SRC

Here's the macro I recorded for doing the above task:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
"C-s"
"C"
"a"
"t"
"e"
"g"
"o"
"r"
"y"
":"
"C-g"
"TAB"
"v"
"TAB"
"C-y"
"TAB"
"TAB"
"Down"
"Down"
"TAB"
"Up"
"Up"
"Up"
"TAB"
"RET"

"C-s"
"C"
"a"
"t"
"e"
"g"
"o"
"r"
"y"
":"
"C-g"
"TAB"
"c"
"TAB"
"C-y"
"TAB"
"TAB"
"Down"
"Down"
"Down"
"Down"
"Down"
"TAB"
"Up"
"Up"
"Up"
"Up"
"Up"
"TAB"
"RET"

"C-s"
"C"
"a"
"t"
"e"
"g"
"o"
"r"
"y"
":"
"C-g"
"TAB"
"s"
"TAB"
"C-y"
"TAB"
"TAB"
"TAB"
"RET"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that I'm using Firemacs, so C-s means search, C-g means cancel,
and C-y means yank (paste).
