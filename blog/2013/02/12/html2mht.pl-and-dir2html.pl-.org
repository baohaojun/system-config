I have been working on 2 piece of perl scripts that convert a whole
directory / a whole bunch of (inter-connected) .html files into a
single page .mht file.

You can get the source code at [[http://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/bin/html2mht.pl][html2mht.pl]] and [[http://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/bin/dir2html.pl][dir2html.pl]].

Here's a small weird thing (aka, bug) I found out about .mht file, ancher does not work in .mht.

More specifically, for e.g., IE does not work when a index.html in a .mht contains a link pointing to chap1.html#sec1, which are also in the same .mht file.

Weird enough, firefox with the unmht plugin works fine with the above situation.

For the html2mht.pl, I must thank the html2mht project on sourceforge.
