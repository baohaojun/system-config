#+title: Doing Android Java Programming in Emacs
# bhj-tags: android emacs

I used to use [[https://github.com/senny/emacs-eclim][Eclim]] as the Emacs Java programming aid. But soon I find
out eclipse scales very badly if I put the whole Android project into
it -- it will take lots of minutes to start, strace showing it
scanning all the .repo/.git/out directories for source code files.

So I switched to grow my own scripts to do the job. Here I will
describe to you what I have achieved, and more importantly, what
remain to be done (it's an embarrassingly long list).

You can watch a (soundless) video of me demoing this tool on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqBPEEjoVX0][youtube]],
but sadly, I cannot view it myself after I upload it (because I'm
behind the Great Kungfu Wall). So if you find problems of this video
(as I can't verify it myself), please view it on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqBPEEjoVX0][youku]]. (The first one
who find the youtube video is OK, please leave a comment below it, so
that I know it. I can read comments/upload, but not watch. Thanks!)

* Features already implemented
  
  Using the features of Eclim as a reference, I have implemented the
  following which I find most useful (and most fun).

** ajoke-get-import

Given a java file, I will parse it and find all the classes/interfaces
missing, and add the corresponding =import= statement at the start of
the java source file.

1. The java.lang.* and classes under the current package are
   recognized so, and not bothered.

2. When the supporting script (described below) find more than one
   class in the whole project with the same name, the elisp command
   =completing-read= will be used to trivially prompt you to choose
   one, as you can see in the video or the screenshot below:

   [[../../../../images/post/emacs-java-import.png][file:../../../../images/post/emacs-java-import.png]]

   Note that I am using anything.el (now renamed as [[http://www.emacswiki.org/Anything][helm]]) to make
   =completing-read= even more friendly.

** ajoke-get-hierarchy

I can use this command to draw the inheritance tree of a class I am
interested in.

Compared to what was provided by Eclim, mine will provide these very
useful pieces of information:

1. Where are all the classes/interfaces in the inheritance tree
   defined.

   This information is provided in a ~compilation-mode~ buffer, so
   that you can easily jump over.

2. Where is the current method defined in all the classes/interfaces
   of the inheritance tree.

3. The java.lang.Object will be shown for the class which as no
   =extends= clause in its declaration.

4. If required (with an option flag for the underlying perl script),
   list all the methods/fields of all the classes/interfaces in the
   tree (see usage below, see FIXMEs below).

You can see it in the video, or the below screenshot, note how the
onCreate method has been show below each of the classes who defines
it.

[[../../../../images/post/emacs-java-hierarchy.png][file:../../../../images/post/emacs-java-hierarchy.png]]

Here is another one showing a similar class and the onKeyUp method.

[[../../../../images/post/ajoke-get-hierarchy.png][file:../../../../images/post/ajoke-get-hierarchy.png]]

** ajoke-resolve

This method seem to be not very useful, but it is depended upon by the
next very useful command.

To put it simply, put the =point= behind =xx.= below and invoke this
command, and it will tell you its type is =java.util.ArrayList= or
simply =ArrayList=, depending on whether you have imported
=ArrayList=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ArrayList<String> xx;
xx.  <= put point here and M-x ajoke-resolve
#+END_EXAMPLE

** ajoke-complete-method

As said above, if you put =point= after =xx.= and invoke
=ajoke-complete-method=, it will let you =completing-read= choose from
all the methods of ArrayList (and its superclass and interfaces's).

It works by reusing ajoke-resolve on =xx= and find its type
=ArrayList=, then ajoke-get-hierarchy on =ArrayList= to list all its
methods.

See the video or the below screenshot:

[[../../../../images/post/ajoke-complete-method.png][file:../../../../images/post/ajoke-complete-method.png]]


** ajoke-get-override

You may need to redefine a method of a parent class/interface, this
elisp command can come to help. You can =completing-read= choose which
method to override. See the video or the screenshot:

[[../../../../images/post/ajoke-get-override.png][file:../../../../images/post/ajoke-get-override.png]]



* Usage

This system is part of my personal configuration system, I have not
found time to exact them into a separate project yet.

It is all in [[https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config][this github project]](and its git submodules). You can
start from the [[http://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/.emacs][.emacs]] and find the scripts under [[http://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/tree/master/bin][bin]].

If you are willing to try my whole configuration, you must use a
recent Debian or Ubuntu distribution, and can do it in following
steps.

 *Warning*: before you start, I highly suggest you create and use a
test account (=sudo useradd=) because your existing =.emacs/.bashrc=
etc. will be moved to =.emacs.bak/.bashrc.bak= and maybe get lost.

** Set up my configuration

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~
git clone --recursive http://github.com/baohaojun/system-config
~/system-config/bin/after-co-ln-s.sh
~/system-config/bin/Linux/after-check-out.sh
#+END_SRC

** Test the system

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~/system-config/gcode/java-test
for-code-reading
ajoke-get-hierarchy.pl Child -m Child
#+END_SRC

You should see output like the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
=> class com.human.Child at com/human/Child.java line 2.
   => interface com.human.Mother at com/human/Mother.java line 2.
#+END_EXAMPLE

* FIXME

This system is far from complete. Even this FIXME list is not
complete, as I can only list those that I am aware of.

Please note that some issues are not meant to be fixed, because fixing
them will turn this tool into exactly the same thing as Eclipse and
get too slow:-)

** Overall problems
+ Not a separate project.

  This will give other people a very difficult choice to use my scripts.

+ only works with android

  Because all the class/method/field information is extracted from the
  java source file using ctags-exuberant, and not from some .jar files
  in the CLASSPATH, the whole java system source code must be present
  for this system to work.

  Android is the only system I know that satisfies this high-demanding
  condition. Maybe I will work on this someday when I need write a
  non-Android project.

+ Some commands are too slow (several seconds to complete a method)

  I think I should someday add additional caching for better
  performance.

** Problems of individual commands

+ ajoke-get-import

  It should not offer to import the android resouce class android.R,
  because an APK project will generate its own R.java in the same
  package.

  And it does not handle generic types very well.

+ ajoke-resolve

  It parse =String[] strArr= as java.lang.String, not as Array.

+ ajoke-get-hierarchy

  When asked to list all methods/fields, it will literally list
  everything, even private ones.

+ ajoke-get-override

  1. Should support batch overriding for e.g., all the methods of an
     interface.

  2. Methods already defined should be filtered out and not offer to
     be overridden again.

* Misc information

** Heavy use of other FLOSS projects
[[http://ctags.sourceforge.net/][ctags-exuberant]] and [[http://www.gnu.org/software/global/][global]] are heavily used.

** Skeleton and regexp rewrite completion

In that video, you will see me type a *skeleten* and get it completed,
this idea is very much like anything.el or (as I think) icicle, ido,
etc. You may also find the Firefox browser's URL completion similar to
this idea.

The usual Emacs completion require matching at the head, for e.g., if
you want to complete this identifier, =savedInstanceState=, you must
type in the beginning part of it =sav=, or =saved=, and press =M-/= to
hippie-expand it. This can be sometimes a bit inconvenient. 

With my completion, I can start typing anything that is in the
identifier, such as =state= or =sainst=, or =vedstst=, as long as the
characters are in the same order as the original word. Here the
skeleton =vedstst= will be rewritten as a regexp by using =(mapconcat
'string "vedstst" ".*")= as =v.*e.*d.*s.*t.*s.*t=, which matches and
completes to the target =savedInstanceState=.

When there are multiple matches, hippie-expand (by default) will
rotate the completions one-by-one, and I have never found out how to
rotate backwards if I rotated one past the right choice. Undo?

With my completion, all the choices are listed in the rough order how
far they are found from the =point= (I think hippie-expand will try
all matches after the =point=, then all those before the =point=; mine
will interleave them), and you can scroll up and down the list (just
like anything.el's =completing-read=).

This tool is so convenient that I don't find some of my java-coding
scrits's bugs so urgent to fix.

You can see in the video or the below screenshot:
[[../../../../images/post/regexp-completion.png][file:../../../../images/post/regexp-completion.png]]

You can find the elisp source in [[http://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/.emacs_d/lisp/skeleton-complete.el][skeleton-complete.el]].

** What about JDEE or other Emacs Java plugins?

I have not tried them. Not a big fan of ecb/cedet etc. because these
tools are not friendly when using them with TRAMP.

** What parser did I use for parsing the java file

I tried ANTLR, but found it too heavy and too slow.

But while trying ANTLR, I learned how Java is a very regular language
compared to C and C++, since it has no preprocessor. So I devised a
simple script to turn a Java source file into its truely most regular
form (hopefully still a 95% valid java program):

1. Get rid of all comment, all whitespace that won't affect sematic
   when removed, and all string/character literals (replacing them all
   with empty string literal =("")=.

   An white space between 2 words such as =public= and =int= is
   non-removable, but a space character after the =>= in
   =ArrayList<String>= can be safely removed (I think).

2. Insert a newline after these 3 characters =(;{})=.

3. Indent it properly if you want it to be more beautiful to the eyes.

An example follows. Given this wildly irregular piece of Java code,
notice how difficult it will be to figure out that the prototype of
=getWordIdx= is =@Override public int getWordIdx(String word){= (maybe
without the =@Override= and the ={=), or even to tell that there is a
method named =getWordIdx=:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
class test 
implements
    stintf {

/*
watch how the following very irregular method will be formatted
beautifully

*/
    
    @Override
    public
	int
	getWordIdx(String
 word) 
    {
ArrayList<String> xx;
if (word == "hello world") {
	return
	    0;
    }
    }
}
#+END_SRC 

You can use [[http://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/bin/flatten.pl][flatten.pl]] to filter it into the following highly regexp
matchable piece of Java, and you can easily extract the whole
prototype of the =getWordIdx= method, or the class declaration line
for =test=:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
class test implements stintf{
    @Override public int getWordIdx(String word){
        ArrayList<String>xx;
        if(word==""){
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
#+END_SRC
