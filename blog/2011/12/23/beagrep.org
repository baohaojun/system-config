#+title: beagrep, grep 2G source code in 0.23 second
# bhj-tags: beagrep

Beagrep can grep ~readlink~ in Android source code in +0.8+ 0.23[fn:improve] second when
cache is hot, and about 11 seconds when cache is cold.

Using [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][ag]] or [[https://github.com/petdance/ack][ack]] or bare grep, the results are a couple of seconds when
cache is hot, or a couple of minutes when the cache is cold[fn:fact].

* Introduction

I still remember when I read the ``Linux Device Drivers'', 1st Edition, in the preface, the author says:

#+begin_quote
... The text you are approaching is the result of hours of patient grepping ...
#+end_quote

I have been using grep to read source code ever since. It's been
adequate for a long time, until I started reading Android source code
with it. I remember vividly how it took me 30 minutes[fn:correction]
to ~grep readlink~ in Android source code (with VCS directory and
binary files excluded).

Then I learned about the beagle software which is a desktop search
engine, and it occurred to me, what if I use beagle and grep together?
I mean, to use beagle first to decide the (relatively a lot smaller)
set of possible matching files (i.e., files that contained the word
~readlink~, taking the previous example), then invoke grep on this set
only. Usually the job can be done in the blink of an eye.

Beagrep is available on GNU/Linux, Mac OS (requires MacPorts) and
Windows (requires CYGWIN). It also works with CJK characters
correctly, as long as the document is in utf8.

Because beagrep is so fast, I have also developped some more use cases
besides simply grepping through Android source code, for e.g., finding
function call sites.

There are other tools similar to beagrep, discussed at the end of this
blog.

(Note a Chinese version of this page is available [[../../../2012/01/31/beagrep-cn.org][here]], but it may be
outdated).

* Install
** Linux install

*** Compile by yourself (the preferred way for Linux install)

To compile beagrep by yourself, using Ubuntu precise as an example:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/baohaojun/beagrep.git -b for-ubuntu-precise
# you can also run "git branch -a" to see other versions of debian/ubuntu supported

# Install build dependencies. You can open debian/control and check
# the build dependencies and install all of them. The following
# command will try to install them automatically, but if it fails then
# you need figure out which packages to install manually. Good luck!
# Or you can contact some debian/ubuntu advanced user for help.
apt-get install $(cat debian/control | perl -ne 'print if m/Build-Depends/..m/Standards-Version/'|grep -v -e Build-Depends:\\\|Standards-Version|perl -npe 's/,/ /g')

# do the build
(set -e; autoreconf -i; ./configure; make -j4; sudo make install; echo OK)
#+end_src

***  <<using.deb>> Using .deb under debian/ubuntu

*Help!* This has stopped working, help needed. Really appreciate if
someone can fix this and tell me what went wrong. See the update
below.

*Update (2014-05-03)* I found that building and installing the lastest
version of beagrep deb package will sometimes cause runtime exception
when running on Ubuntu 12.04 (and maybe other versions too /2014-12-17/). So you are encouraged to build and
install from source code directly, which does not show this
problem. Another reason is these packages is quite outdated.

I have provided several .deb package files on github, one for debian
testing, 3 for ubuntu lucid(10.04), oneiric(11.10) and
precise(12.04). They are all for amd64. If you happen to be using one
of these, you can download them [[https://github.com/baohaojun/beagrep/downloads][here]]. Here's how to install it using
ubuntu 12.04 as an example. After you have downloaded the .deb file:

#+begin_src sh
dpkg -i beagrep-for-ubuntu-precise-2012-09-05-ae0a1a2.deb
# The above step will probably get dependency errors, so you fix it:
apt-get -f install
# This will install the dependence packages.
#+end_src



*** Build .deb by yourself

*Help!* This has stopped working, help needed. Really appreciate if
someone can fix this and tell me what went wrong. See the update
below.

*Update (2014-05-03)* I found that building and installing the lastest

Before someone volunteer to make beagrep into debian/ubuntu
distribution, you might also find a need to build .deb by yourself
(for e.g., to help your colleagues use beagrep easily without needing
to compile it themselves).

Here's how I do it:

1. Make sure you can compile beagrep manually by referring to the
   previous section.

2. Make a tar.gz of beagrep (note that the filename must be exact, it
   is required by dpkg):

   : tar czfv ~/.cache/beagrep_0.4.0.orig.tar.gz beagrep --exclude-vcs

3. Untar it and build the .deb package:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   cd ~/tmp
   tar zxfv beagrep_0.4.0.orig.tar.gz
   cd beagrep
   dpkg-buildpackage
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   The .deb file is generated in the =~/tmp= directory.

4. Refer to [[using.deb]] for how to install.

** Windows install

Windows install can only be done compiling by yourself, and be warned,
it's not easy...

*** Install dependencies

You need install CYGWIN, Mono and sqlite for Windows.

For cygwin, you will need the following packages as the minimum (there
might be more, though I have tested these should be enough):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      nc util-linux git vim rsync inetutils apache2 shutdown make
      gnome-common gcc-core gcc-g++ mingw-gcc-core mingw-gcc-g++
      mingw64-i686-gcc-core mingw64-i686-gcc-g++
      mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++ screen
      cygutils-extra procps wget git-svn
#+END_EXAMPLE


(See [[https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/bin/windows/after-check-out.sh][after-check-out.sh]] for how I installed these packages automatically).

For Mono, default download and install from mono project website is OK.

For sqlite, you need download the .zip file for Windows and extract
the .dll into your $PATH.

*** Get beagrep Windows code

#+begin_src sh
git clone git://github.com/baohaojun/beagrep.git -b for-windows
#+end_src

*** Compile and install

#+begin_src sh
cd beagrep
bash build-win.sh "/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Mono-3.2.3"
#+end_src

Now, the argument to build-win.sh is the folder where I have installed
mono, on my windows7, it is ~/cygdrive/c/Program Files
(x86)/Mono-3.2.3~. One thing very important in building and using
beagrep on Windows is to get the directory name format correct,
because Windows has very weird characters in its pathname, =:= and
=Space=, which is harmful for writing Makefile and Shell scripts,
respectively.

**** Fixing errors during build

Note that when you are building, compilation will fail complaining
=/usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-mingw32/4.5.2/libstdc++.la= not found, this is
because it is specified in =C:/Program Files
(x86)/Mono-3.2.3/lib/pkgconfig/mono.pc=, and you need to edit this
file to remove it.

* Usage

** Quick smoke test
#+begin_src sh
cd /tmp; mkdir $$; cd $$; echo main > 1.txt; mkbeagrepidx; beagrep -e 'main' --grep '--color=auto'; true; cd ..; rm $$ -rf
#+end_src

If beagrep has been installed correctly, at the end of the above
command's output, you should see something like
~/.cache/11468/1.txt:1:main~.

** Create index

In your source code directory, using android as example:

#+begin_src sh
cd ~/src/android
mkbeagrepidx
#+end_src

This step will cost you quite some time, under my Linux indexing
Android cost me about half an hour (it's about the same time you run
grep directly on android source). So I'd advise you create a cron job
to do it at midnight.

It takes about 8 minutes to index linux kernel (v3.6-rc6):

#+begin_example
Debug: IndexWorker Done
Debug: Elapsed time 478.01s.
#+end_example

But the good news is if indexing has already been done before, there
re-indexing will only work on those updated files based on file
time-stamp. So it will cost you only a few minutes to re-index the
whole Android source.

Even better, after an initial indexing, you can do a sub-folder
re-index, ~mkbeagrepidx~ will ask you if you want to update the index
found for upper directory. This generally only takes seconds depending
on the size of the sub-folder.

** Man page for mkbeagrepidx

mkbeagrepidx is a simple wrapper over beagrep-build-index. You can
configure it for which directories to ignore using
~--deny-directory-pattern~ option. By default,

- The ~$PWD/out~ is ignored, because it contains android build output
- The */.git is ignored, because of well known reason
- The */.repo is ignored, for the same reason.

The syntax is comma separated shell glob patterns, and you can check
how it is converted into regular expression by examining the beginning
of mkbeagrepidx output:

#+begin_example
Always: Will ignore directories matching regular expression: ^(?:/home/bhj/tmp/test/out)$|^(?:.*/\.repo)$|^(?:.*/\.git)$
#+end_example

You can customize it using several ways, in the order of increasing
priority:

- Not customize it, then the default

  #+begin_example
  "$PWD/out,*/.repo,*/.git"
  #+end_example

  will be used.

- Override it in =~/.mkbeagrepidx.rc=, setting the ~BEAGREP_IGNORE_DIR_PATTERNS~ environment variable:

  #+begin_src sh
  export BEAGREP_IGNORE_DIR_PATTERNS="$PWD/out,*/.repo,*/.git"
  #+end_src

- Override it in the .mkbeagrepidx.rc in the current working directory, same as the above.

- Override it on the command line (you must repeat the default pattern
  because it won't append):

  #+begin_src sh
  mkbeagrepidx --deny-directory-pattern "$PWD/out,*/.repo,*/.git,*/.svn"
  #+end_src


** Searching using beagrep

Under your source code directory:
#+begin_src sh
cd ~/src/android
beagrep -e "readlink"
#+end_src

*** Man page for beagrep

Here's a list of all arguments that beagrep takes:

#+begin_example
beagrep -e REGEXP_MATCH [-p REGEXP_PATH] [-a ADDITIONAL_WORDS] [-v REGEXP_REVERSE_PATH] [-i] [-f] [-l] [--grep GREP_OPTIONS] [-a]
#+end_example

- -e ~REGEXP_MATCH~ :: This is the minimum required arguments. For e.g., ~beagrep -e readlink~

     The ~REGEXP_MATCH~ serves 2 purposes:

     - First, it is computed into whole words for querying beagle. For
       e.g., ~l] [--grep GREP_OPTIONS]~ above should be matched with
       the following REGEXP: ~l\] \[--grep GREP_OPTIONS\]~, but it
       should be converted into 4 words: ~l grep GREP OPTIONS~ for
       beagle.

     - Second, it is used as the regexp for grep to work on.

- -a ~ADDITIONAL_WORDS~ :: means to add more words into the beagle
     query. This is useful by increasing the work beagle need to do,
     but reduce the possible work set grep need to work on.

- -p ~REGEXP_PATH~ :: means to limit the search result to those files whose path-name matches ~REGEXP_PATH~.

- -v ~REGEXP_REVERSE_PATH~ :: means to exclude those matched files whose path-name matches ~REGEXP_REVERSE_PATH~.

- -i :: means to do case insignificant grep.

- -f :: means to do the match in file-names only. For example, ~beagrep
        -e readlink -f~ will only show results like readlink.h and
        readlink.c.

	This is very useful for finding files. Note that when ~-f~ is
        used, the beagle querying words will be computed differently:
        only the basename will be used, and ~filename:~ is prepended
        onto each words.

- -l :: means to list the beagle matched list of files directly, without running grep to match on them.

- --grep ~GREP_OPTIONS~ :: means to pass additional arguments to the
     grep invocation. For e.g., the ~-l~ argument can be passed to
     beagrep directly, or it can be passed using ~--grep~, they mean different things:

     ~beagrep -e "hello world" -l~ will show a file containing "hello
     wonderful world", but ~beagrep -e "hello world" --grep -l~ will
     not show that file as a match.


* How does it work?

beagrep is a very practical software, it works because of the following observations:

** grep patterns are usually simple

Or rather, they can be decomposed into several simple sub-patterns: whole words.

For example, to grep such a seemingly complex pattern in Android source code:

#+begin_example
"JsonToValue(\"\\\\\"hello world\\\\\"\","
#+end_example

In fact, it contained some simpler sub-patterns, i.e., those 3
wholesome English words: ~JsonToValue~ ~hello~ ~world~. For a file to
match this complex pattern, one necessary but not sufficient condition
is for this file to contain all these 3 words. And what is good for
this job? A search engine! Using beagle, the parent project for
beagrep, a desktop search engine, you can find which files (actually,
which file in this case) contained these 3 words in the blink of an
eye.

Only 1 file contained all 3 words:

#+begin_example
$beagrep-files 'JsonToValue hello world '
Beagrep index found at /home/bhj/.cache/for-code-reading//home/bhj/src/gingerbread-tegra/.beagrep
/home/bhj/src/gingerbread-tegra/external/chromium/base/json/json_reader_unittest.cc
/dev/null
#+end_example

So, you can imagine how quick it is to run ~grep~ on the set of files containing all required words:


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
beagrep -e "JsonToValue(\"\\\\\"hello world\\\\\"\","
pat is: 'JsonToValue("\\"hello world\\"",'.
beagrep query argument `JsonToValue hello world '
Beagrep index found at /home/bhj/.cache/for-code-reading//home/bhj/src/gingerbread-tegra/.beagrep
/home/bhj/src/gingerbread-tegra/external/chromium/base/json/json_reader_unittest.cc:168:  root.reset(JSONReader().JsonToValue("\"hello world\"", false, false));
Unmatched ( in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/JsonToValue( <-- HERE ""hello world"",/ at /home/bhj/bin/beagrep line 98.
#+END_EXAMPLE

To summarize, complete words are what search engines are good for, and
fortunately, when grepping source code, we almost always grep using
whole words, instead of sub-words. For e.g., this evil pattern
~r.*e.*a.*d.*l.*i.*n.*k~ can match our ~readlink~, but do you really
need that power of ~grep~?

*** BTW, creating the regexp pattern automatically in Emacs

From the example above, you can see the actual matched string is:

#+begin_example
JsonToValue("\"hello world\"",
#+end_example

but because of meta characters in regexp and shell, the regexp pattern for beagrep to work on is a lot more complex:

#+begin_example
"JsonToValue(\"\\\\\"hello world\\\\\"\","
#+end_example

It'd be tragedy if you need type all those ~\~ characters by
yourself. So of course I didn't. In fact, when you work in Emacs,
after you marked some text and press ~C-u M-x grep~, Emacs will
correctly add the ~\~ -s for you, to convert this plain text into a
matching regexp (which can be passed to grep by the shell).

Note that last time I checked, the Emacs grep regexp generation code
has some bugs, so I rolled my own fix for it, you can check my [[https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/.emacs][.emacs]]
for definition of ~grep-default-command~ and
~grep-shell-quote-argument~.

** grep keywords are usually interesting

beagrep can greatly quicken the speed of grep, only because it can
greatly reduce the working set of files for grep.

Note that you need provide interesting words to search for so as to
*greatly* reduce the working set. By interesting I mean non-common.

For e.g., say you want to grep ~is~. This word is so common in English
that almost all files would probably contain it (source code file will
probably contain it in comments). Then you are basically running grep
nakedly on the whole android source.

Fortunately, this requirement is easy to meet. In the first place, you
probably don't want to grep for common words; and even if you do need
to, you probably won't grep for one common word *alone*, which is very
uninteresting; thirdly, even if you do need to ~grep~ for a common
word alone, you can provide more words for ~beagrep~ to work on by
using its ~-a~ option (see the manpage above).

So:

- Don't grep for ~include~ alone, because almost all C/C++ source and
  header files contain it.

- Don't grep for ~import~ alone, because almost all java source files
  contain it.

And so on.

* Other projects using beagrep

Because beagrep is so fast, I have used it in a couple other projects/tools.

** offline Wikipedia

I added CJK character support into beagrep so that both English and
Chinese offline Wikipedia can be browsed and subject-searched.

Check it out at [[https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config]], sorry I
didn't make it a stand-alone project, it's under the
~gcode/offline.wikipedia~ directory.

** ~grep-func-call~ and ~grep-func-call-all~

These 2 scripts generate the function usage relationship for easier
code reading. Given a function funcA, which is used in a bunch of other functions in the system, these 2 scripts work like this:

1. Use beagrep to find out in which files funcA appears.

2. Run ctags-exuberant to tag these files, get the function definition
   lines: In file FileF, funcB is defined on line N, funcC is defined
   on line M, and no other functions are between N and M.

3. If funcA appears in FileF, between line N and line M, then funcB
   calls funcA. This is not precise, but it's good enough.

4. It not only works with functions, but also with almost all complete
   words that beagrep can handle.

The first script works with the current Emacs buffer only, the 2nd
works system-wide, searching function call sites though out the whole
source repo.

See the following output, note that grep-mode is used for jumping
around, and ~=> and <=~ is used to denote the caller and callee:

** Generate call graph

This is a tool to generate a call graph for the software project you
want. I have found its effectiveness is to be questioned, but you can
see a picture below:

[[../../../../images/post/call-graph.png][file:../../../../images/post/call-graph.png]]

This picture is generated for the adb sub-project in android code. You
can see which functions are calling ~adb_connect~, and which functions
are called by it.

It is generated using beagrep + ctags-exuberant + graphviz, using my
wrap scripts like following in the android/system/core directory:

#+begin_src sh
generate-call-graph.pl > call_graph.org
dot-partition.pl call_graph.dot -s adb_connect -m 1 -r 2
#+end_src

* Other tools similar to beagrep

** Opengrok

[[https://blogs.oracle.com/chandan/entry/the_story_of_opengrok_the][This tool]] is very much like beagrep, it also uses the Lucene search
engine! Beagrep uses beagle, which uses the C# implementation of
Lucene. I probably wouldn't start working on beagrep had I known
opengrok earlier. That said, I'm glad I have beagrep, because it is
Emacs friendlier😊

I do not use opengrok myself since I have beagrep already, but you are
encouraged to try it out, it has quite a few nice features. Especially
if you do not use Emacs for reading and writing code.

** Ack/Ag

These 2 tools are faster grep, they do not use indexing. Author of Ack
has maintained a quite complete list of other grep-like tools at [[http://beyondgrep.com/more-tools/][this
web page]]. Both opengrok and beagrep are listed there.

[fn:improve] Here's how I improved it from 0.8s to 0.23s: use Mono's
AOT option to do the JIT optimization Ahead Of Time. I found out about
this option when I was investigating why beagrep on my
MacbookAir+Linux is consistently a few tenths of second slower than
other machines, which is another story, see [[../../../2013/05/03/beagrep-even-faster2.org][beagrep performance tuning
on MacbookAir+Linux]].

[fn:fact] Here's how I run =grep= in Android source tree: ~time grep
          -I -r --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.repo -e readlink~
          =~/src/android=. The first time it took 5m20s, second time
          1m21s, and third time 3.5s, and it can't be reduced much
          further. The result is retrieved on a ThinkPad T420 with 8G
          memory. One thing notable here I think is that it could
          require multiple runs to reach the minimum 3.5s. Another
          thing is I tried it multiple times on my MacbookAir with
          about the same debian installation, =grep= always takes
          about 1m as the minimum. Was it because less memory (only 4G
          for MacbookAir), or was it because SSD and thus different
          caching strategy? It eludes me. (*EDIT*: it's because cpu
          freq is locked at 800MHz, same as the above footnote, see
          [[../../../2013/05/03/beagrep-even-faster2.org][beagrep performance tuning on MacbookAir+Linux]].)

[fn:correction] As stated in the previous footnote, something must
have went wrong with this result, 30 minutes is just impossibly long
compared to the 5m20s cache cold and 3.5s cache hot stated above. Was
it because of a slower machine, or even being run within a virtual
machine (on a slower real machine)?  I can neither remember nor
reproduce now. But I think one problem was the way I used =grep=, it's
something along the line of: ~find-filter-out-non-src-files | xargs
grep readlink~. This will cause a lot of ~grep~ processes to be
created because on most systems there is a max number of characters
(typically 128k on 32 bit systems) limit with the command line
arguments. When this limit is exceeded, you will see something like
=bash: XXX: Argument list too long=. For this reason, xargs will call
its command multiple times. For e.g., when I run this command: =seq 1
1000000 | xargs bash -c 'echo -n $#\ ' true=, you'd expect =1000000=
is printed, because xargs will pass this many arguments to the bash
command, but no, instead you will see (try it, see how slow it is!)
=23692 21841 21841 21841...= printed one by one because xargs must
invoke this bash command multiple times and each time pass just as
many arguments as possible. This is not the most efficient way for
calling grep (with all the arguments creating and passing around and
grep processes creating and exiting) and must have contributed to my
30 minutes measurement.
