1 Installation
**************

Magithub can be installed from MELPA
(http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/magithub) using ‘M-x list-packages’ or by
evaluating the following:

     (package-install 'magithub)

   Here is the basic recommended ‘use-package’
(https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) configuration:

     (use-package magithub
       :after magit
       :ensure t
       :config (magithub-feature-autoinject t))

   If you prefer to install the package manually, this can of course be
done via the usual means.

   For more information, see *note (emacs)Packages::.

File: magithub.info,  Node: Authentication,  Next: Enterprise Support,  Up: Installation

1.1 Authentication
==================

Given GitHub’s rate-limiting policy, Magithub is unlikely to ever
support running without authenticating.  As such, you _must_
authenticate before you use Magithub.  (As of #107, Magithub will not
even attempt go online until you’re properly authenticated.)

   To authenticate, you can simply start using Magithub; Ghub should
walk you through the authentication process unless you use two-factor
authentication.  (Your token is stored in one of your ‘auth-sources’;
see Ghub’s manual
(https://magit.vc/manual/ghub/How-Ghub-uses-Auth_002dSource.html#How-Ghub-uses-Auth_002dSource)
for details.)

   If you do use two-factor authentication, you must

   • Manually create a GitHub token (from
     <https://github.com/settings/tokens>) for scopes ‘repo‘,
     ‘notifications‘ and ‘user‘ (see variable
     ‘magithub-github-token-scopes’)

   • Store it for Magithub per user in one of your ‘auth-sources’ (e.g.
     ‘~/.authinfo’).  Write a line like this:

          machine api.github.com login YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME^magithub password YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN

   Beware that writing the token in plaintext in ‘~/.authinfo’ (or
elsewhere) is not secure against attackers with access to that file.
For details and better alternatives (like using GPG), see Ghub’s manual
on Manually Creating and Storing a Token
(https://magit.vc/manual/ghub/Manually-Creating-and-Storing-a-Token.html#Manually-Creating-and-Storing-a-Token)
and How Ghub uses Auth-Source
(https://magit.vc/manual/ghub/How-Ghub-uses-Auth_002dSource.html#How-Ghub-uses-Auth_002dSource).

   If you want to authenticate Ghub without using Magithub, you can
simply evaluate the following:

     (require 'magithub)
     (ghub-get "/user" nil :auth 'magithub)

   After Ghub walks you through the authentication process during
evaluation, the ‘ghub-get’ form should return familiar information (your
login, email, etc.).

   If you’re having trouble _authenticating_, open a Ghub issue
(https://github.com/magit/ghub/issues/new) or drop by Magithub’s
(https://gitter.im/vermiculus/magithub) or Magit’s
(https://gitter.im/magit/magit) Gitter channel.

1.2 Enterprise Support
======================

For GitHub Enterprise support, you’ll need to add your enterprise domain
to ‘magithub-github-hosts’ so that Magithub can detect when it’s in a
GitHub repository.  You will also need to configure your ‘~/.authinfo’
file appropriately to authenticate to your domain; see Ghub’s manual for
details.

2 Introduction
**************

Magithub tries to follow closely Magit’s lead in general interface.
Most of its functionality is developed to tightly integrate with its
section/ framework.  See Magit’s documentation
(https://magit.vc/manual/magit/Sections.html#Sections) for information
on how to navigate using this framework.

   Magithub’s functionality uses section-specific keymaps to expose
functionality.  Where it makes sense, the following keys will map to
functions that ’do the right thing’:

‘w’     (‘magithub-browse-thing’)

     Open a browser to the thing at point.  For instance, when point is
     on issue 42 in your-favorite/github-repo, we’ll open
     ‘http://github.com/your-favorite/github-repo/issue/42’.

‘a’     (‘magithub-add-thing’)

     Add something to the thing at point.  For instance, on a list of
     labels, you can add more labels.

‘e’     (‘magithub-edit-thing’)

     Edit the thing at point, such as an issue.

‘r’     (‘magithub-reply-thing’)

     Reply to the thing at point, such as a comment.

   Magithub also considers the similar placeholder commands introduced
by Magit which you may already be familiar with:

‘k’     (‘magit-delete-thing’)
‘RET’     (‘magit-visit-thing’)

   These concepts are intended to provide a more consistent experience
throughout Magithub within Magit by categorizing your broader
interactions with all GitHub content.  As with Magit, more commands are
added as the situation calls for it.

2.1 Note
========

By default, Magithub enables itself in all repositories where ‘origin’
points to GitHub.

 -- User Option: magithub-enabled-by-default

     When non-nil, Magithub is enabled by default.  This is the fallback
     value of git variable ‘magithub.enabled’ is not set in this
     repository.

 -- User Option: magithub-github-hosts

     A list of top-level domains that should be recognized as GitHub
     hosts.

2.2 Brief Tutorial
==================

Here’s a script that will guide you through the major features of
Magithub.  This is not a replacement for the documentation, but rather
an example workflow to whet your appetite.

* Menu:

* Clone a repository::
* Viewing project status::
* Viewing and replying to an issue::
* Creating an issue::
* Creating a pull request::


File: magithub.info,  Node: Clone a repository,  Next: Viewing project status,  Up: Brief Tutorial

2.2.1 Clone a repository
------------------------

     M-x magithub-clone RET vermiculus/my-new-repository
   Cloning a repository this way gets the clone URL from GitHub and
forwards that on to ‘magit-clone’.  If the repository is a fork, you’re
prompted to add the parent is added under the ‘upstream’ remote.

   Fork behavior may change in the future.  It may be more appropriate
to actually/ clone the source repository and add your remote as a fork.
This will cover the 90% case (the 10% case being active forks of
unmaintained projects).


File: magithub.info,  Node: Viewing project status,  Next: Viewing and replying to an issue,  Prev: Clone a repository,  Up: Brief Tutorial

2.2.2 Viewing project status
----------------------------

You are dropped into a status buffer for ‘vermiculus/my-new-repository’.
You see some open issues and pull requests.  You move your cursor to an
issue of interest and ‘TAB’ to expand it, seeing the author, when it was
created/updated, any labels, and a preview of the issue contents.

   If ‘vermiculus/my-new-repository’ used any status checks, you would
see those statuses as a header in this buffer.


File: magithub.info,  Node: Viewing and replying to an issue,  Next: Creating an issue,  Prev: Viewing project status,  Up: Brief Tutorial

2.2.3 Viewing and replying to an issue
--------------------------------------

You ‘RET’ on the issue and are taken to a dedicated buffer for that
issue.  You can now see its full contents as well as all comments.
You’d like to leave a comment – a suggestion for a fix or an additional
use-case to consider – you press ‘r’ to open a new buffer to _reply_ to
this issue.  You write your comment and ‘C-c C-c’ to submit.  But, oh
no!  You didn’t turn on ‘flyspell-mode’ in markdown buffers, so you
submitted a spelling error.  A simple ‘e’ on the comment will _edit_ it.
After submitting again with ‘C-c C-c’, everything is well.

   Right now, other activity on the issue is not inserted into this
buffer.  Press ‘w’ to open the issue in your browser.


File: magithub.info,  Node: Creating an issue,  Next: Creating a pull request,  Prev: Viewing and replying to an issue,  Up: Brief Tutorial

2.2.4 Creating an issue
-----------------------

You notice a small issue in how some feature is implemented, so back in
the status buffer, you use ‘H i’ to create a new issue.  (While inside
the GitHub repository, you could’ve used any key bound to
‘magithub-issue-new’.)  The first line is the title of the new issue;
everything else is the body.  You submit the issue with ‘C-c C-c’.

   You come back a little while later to leave additional details – you
reply to your own issue in a comment, but realize you should just edit
your original issue to avoid confusion.  You ‘k’ to _kill_ / delete the
comment.


File: magithub.info,  Node: Creating a pull request,  Prev: Creating an issue,  Up: Brief Tutorial

2.2.5 Creating a pull request
-----------------------------

Since you care about this project and want to help it succeed, you
decide to fix this issue yourself.  You checkout a new branch (‘b c
my-feature RET’) and get to work.

   Because you’re so _awesome_, you’re ready to push your commit to fix
your issue.  After realizing you don’t have push permissions to this
repository, you create a fork using ‘H f’.  You push your branch to your
new remote (named after your username) and create a pull request with ‘H
p’.  You select the head branch as ‘my-feature’ and the base branch as
‘master’ (or whatever the production/staging branch is for the project).
You fill out the pull request template provided by the project (and
inserted into your PR) and off you go!

3 Status Buffer Integration
***************************

The part of Magithub you’re likely to interact with the most is embedded
right into Magit’s status buffer.

‘H’     (‘magithub-dispatch-popup’)

     Access many Magithub entry-points.  See *note Dispatch Popup:: for
     more details.

‘H e’     (‘FIXME’)

     Toggle status buffer integration in this repository.

   There are two integrations turned on by default:

* Menu:

* Project Status::
* Open Issues and Pull Requests::


File: magithub.info,  Node: Project Status,  Next: Open Issues and Pull Requests,  Up: Status Buffer Integration

3.1 Project Status
==================

Many services (such as Travis CI and CircleCI) will post statuses to
commits.  A summary of these statuses are visible in the status buffer
headers.

‘RET’     (‘magithub-ci-visit’)
‘w’     (‘magithub-ci-visit’)

     Visit the service’s summary of this status.  For example, a status
     posted by Travis CI will open that build on Travis.

‘g’     (‘magithub-ci-refresh’)

     Refresh statuses from GitHub and then refresh the current buffer.

‘H s’     (‘FIXME’)

     Enable/disable status checks in this repository.


File: magithub.info,  Node: Open Issues and Pull Requests,  Prev: Project Status,  Up: Status Buffer Integration

3.2 Open Issues and Pull Requests
=================================

These will also display in the status buffer.  There’s a lot of
functionality available right from an issue section.

‘g’     (‘magithub-issue-refresh’)

     Refresh issues and pull requests from GitHub and then refresh the
     current buffer.

‘RET’     (‘magithub-issue-visit’)

     Open a new buffer to view an issue and its comments.

‘w’     (‘magithub-issue-browse’)
‘w’     (‘magithub-pull-browse’)

     Browse this issue / pull request on GitHub.

‘N’     (‘magithub-issue-personal-note’)

     Opens a buffer for offline note-taking.

‘L’     (‘magithub-issue-add-labels’)

     Add labels to the issue.

‘a’     (‘magithub-label-add’)
‘k’     (‘magithub-label-remove’)

     When point is on a label section, you can add/remove labels
     (provided you have permission to do so).

 -- Command: magithub-label-color-replace

     Labels are colored as they would be on GitHub.  In some themes,
     this produces an illegible or otherwise undesirable color.  This
     command can help you find a substitute for labels of this color.

 -- Variable: magithub-issue-details-hook

     Control which issue details display in the status buffer.
     Functions intended for this variable use the
     ‘magithub-issue-detail-insert-*’ prefix.

     Performance note: judicious use of this variable can improve your
     overall Magit experience in large buffers.

 -- User Option: magithub-issue-issue-filter-functions
 -- User Option: magithub-issue-pull-request-filter-functions

     These are lists of functions which must all return non-nil for an
     issue/PR to be displayed in the status buffer.  They all receive
     the issue/PR object as their sole argument.  For example, you might
     want to filter out issues labels ‘enhancement’ from your list:

          (setq magithub-issue-issue-filter-functions
                (list (lambda (issue)          ; don't show enhancement requests
                        (not
                         (member "enhancement"
                                 (let-alist issue
                                   (ghubp-get-in-all '(name) .labels)))))))

File: magithub.info,  Node: Manipulating the Cache,  Next: Offline Mode,  Up: Open Issues and Pull Requests

3.2.1 Manipulating the Cache
----------------------------

When point is on a Magithub-controlled section (like the status header):
Default Key   Description
-----------------------------------------------------------
‘g’           Refresh only this section’s GitHub content
‘C-u g’       Like ‘g’, but works on the whole buffer


File: magithub.info,  Node: Offline Mode,  Next: Controlling Sections,  Prev: Manipulating the Cache,  Up: Open Issues and Pull Requests

3.2.2 Offline Mode
------------------

Default Key   Description
------------------------------------
‘H C c’       Toggle offline mode

   Offline mode was introduced for those times when you’re on the go,
but you’d still like to have an overview of GitHub data in your status
buffer.  It’s also useful for folks who want to explicitly control when
Emacs communicates with GitHub – for this purpose, you can use ‘C-u g’
(discussed above) to pull data from GitHub while in offline mode.

   To start into offline mode everywhere, use
     git config --global magithub.cache always

   See the documentation for function
‘magithub-settings--set-magithub.cache’ for details on appropriate
values.


File: magithub.info,  Node: Controlling Sections,  Prev: Offline Mode,  Up: Open Issues and Pull Requests

3.2.3 Controlling Sections
--------------------------

Sections like the issue list and the status header can be toggled with
the interactive functions of the form ‘magithub-toggle-*’.  These
functions have no default keybinding.

   Since status checks can be API-hungry and not all projects use them,
you can disable the status header at the repository-level with ‘H ~’;
see the Status Checks section for more information.


File: magithub.info,  Node: Dispatch Popup,  Next: 'Features',  Prev: Status Buffer Integration,  Up: Top

4 Dispatch Popup
****************

Much of Magithub’s functionality, including configuration options, is
behind this popup.  In Magit status buffers, it’s bound to ‘H’.

‘d’     (‘magithub-dashboard’)

     See *note Dashboard::.

‘c’     (‘magithub-create’)

     Push a local repository up to GitHub.

‘H’     (‘magithub-browse’)

     Open the current repository in your browser.

‘f’     (‘magithub-fork’)

     Fork this repository on GitHub.  This will add your fork as a
     remote under your username.  For example, if user ‘octocat’ forked
     Magit, we would see a new remote called ‘octocat’ pointing to
     ‘octocat/magit’.

‘i’     (‘magithub-issue-new’)
‘p’     (‘magithub-pull-request-new’)

     Open a new buffer to create an issue or open a pull request.  See
     *note Creating Content::.

* Menu:

* Configuration::
* Meta::


File: magithub.info,  Node: Configuration,  Next: Meta,  Up: Dispatch Popup

4.1 Configuration
=================

Per-repository configuration is controlled via git variables reachable
from the dispatch popup via ‘H C’.  Use ‘? <key>’ to get online help for
each variable in that popup.

‘C e’     (‘FIXME’)

     Turn Magithub on/off (completely).

‘C s’     (‘FIXME’)

     Turn the project status header on/off.

‘C c’     (‘FIXME’)

     Control whether Magithub is considered ’online’.  This controls the
     behavior of the the cache.  This may go away in the future.  See
     Controlling the Cache for more details.  FIXME there is no such
     node.

‘C i’     (‘FIXME’)

     Toggle the issues section.

‘C p’     (‘FIXME’)

     Toggle the pull requests section.

‘C x’     (‘FIXME’)

     Set the ’proxy’ used for this repository.  See *note Proxies::.


File: magithub.info,  Node: Meta,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: Dispatch Popup

4.2 Meta
========

Since Magithub is so integrated with Magit, there’s often confusion
about whom to ask for support (especially for users of preconfigured
Emacsen like Spacemacs and Prelude).  Hopefully, these functions can
direct you to the appropriate spot.

‘&’     (‘magithub--meta-new-issue’)

     Open the browser to create a new issue for Magithub functionality
     described in this document.

‘h’     (‘magithub--meta-help’)

     Open the browser to ask for help on Gitter, a GitHub-focused
     chatroom.


File: magithub.info,  Node: 'Features',  Next: Cloning,  Prev: Dispatch Popup,  Up: Top

5 ’Features’
************

Given that some features of Magithub are not desired by or appropriate
for every type of user, there are features that are not turned on by
default.  These are features that are injected into standard Magit
popups.

   The list of available features is available in constant
‘magithub-feature-list’.  Despite its name, this is an alist of symbols
(i.e., ’features’) to functions that install the feature.  While the
documentation for each feature lives in that symbol, you would normally
not otherwise interact with it.

 -- Function: magithub-feature-autoinject

     This function is the expected interface to install features.  You
     will normally use
          (magithub-feature-autoinject t)
     in your configuration to install all features, but you have the
     option of installing them one at a time using the symbols from
     constant ‘magithub-feature-list’ or as a list of those symbols:
          (magithub-feature-autoinject 'commit-browse)
          (magithub-feature-autoinject '(commit-browse pull-request-merge))


File: magithub.info,  Node: Cloning,  Next: Dashboard,  Prev: 'Features',  Up: Top

6 Cloning
*********

 -- Command: magithub-clone

     Clone a repository from GitHub.

 -- User Option: magithub-clone-default-directory

     The default destination directory to use for cloning.

 -- User Option: magithub-preferred-remote-method

     This option is a symbol indicating the preferred cloning method
     (between HTTPS, SSH, and the ‘git://’ protocol).


File: magithub.info,  Node: Dashboard,  Next: Creating Content,  Prev: Cloning,  Up: Top

7 Dashboard
***********

The dashboard shows you information pertaining to _you_:
   • notifications

   • issues and pull requests you’re assigned per repository
   as well as contextual information like the logged-in user and
rate-limiting (https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting)
information.

 -- Command: magithub-dashboard

     View your dashboard.

‘;’     (‘magithub-dashboard-popup’)

     Configure your global dashboard settings.

 -- User Option: magithub-dashboard-show-read-notifications

     When non-nil, we’ll show read notifications in the dashboard.


File: magithub.info,  Node: Creating Content,  Next: Caching,  Prev: Dashboard,  Up: Top

8 Creating Content
******************

It’s great to read about what’s been happening, but it’s even better to
contribute your own thoughts and activity!

‘H i’     (‘magithub-issue-new’)
‘H p’     (‘magithub-pull-request-new’)

     Create issues and pull requests.  If you have push access to the
     repository, you’ll have the opportunity to add labels before you
     submit the issue.

     Creating a pull request requires a HEAD branch, a BASE branch, and
     to know which remote points to your fork.

‘r’     (‘magithub-comment-new’)
‘r’     (‘magithub-comment-reply’)

     On an issue or pull request section, ‘magithub-comment-new’ will
     allow you to post a comment to that issue/PR. If point is already
     on a comment, ‘magithub-comment-reply’ will quote the comment at
     point for you.


File: magithub.info,  Node: Caching,  Next: Proxies,  Prev: Creating Content,  Up: Top

9 Caching
*********

Caching is a complicated topic with a long Magithub history of, well,
failure.  As of today, all data retrieved from the API is cached by
default.  Using ‘g’ on Magithub sections will usually refresh the
information in the buffer pertaining to that section.  Otherwise, ‘C-u
g’ in any Magit buffer will refresh all GitHub data in that buffer.

   This behavior may change in the future, but for now, it’s the most
stable option.  See


File: magithub.info,  Node: Proxies,  Next: Unfiled,  Prev: Caching,  Up: Top

10 Proxies
**********

It’s not uncommon to have repositories where the bug-tracker is in a
separate repository.  For these cases, you can use the idea of
’proxies’.  A proxy is a remote (with a GitHub-associated URL) that you
choose to use for all GitHub API requests concerning the _actual_
current repository.  This is manifest in the git variable
‘magithub.proxy’.

 -- Function: magithub-proxy-set-default

     If you consistently use a specific remote name for the bug tracker,
     you can set it globally.

   All GitHub requests specific to the current repository context are
routed through ‘magithub-repo’ which respects this proxy.

   ‘magithub-clone’ may appear to be a thin wrapper over ‘magit-clone’,
but it’s quite a bit smarter than that.  We’ll of course respect
‘magithub-preferred-remote-method’ when cloning the repository, but we
can also detect when the repository is a fork and can create and set an
upstream remote accordingly (similar to ‘M-x magithub-fork’).

11.1.1.2 *DONE* Issues
......................

Default Key   Description
-----------------------------------------
‘H i’         Create a new issue
‘RET’         Open the issue in GitHub

   You can filter issues with ‘magithub-issue-issue-filter-functions’:
     (setq magithub-issue-issue-filter-functions
           (list (lambda (issue) ; don't show enhancement requests
                   (not
                    (member "enhancement"
                            (let-alist issue
                              (ghubp-get-in-all '(name) .labels)))))))
   Each function in the ‘*-functions’ list must return non-nil for the
issue to appear in the issue list.  See also the documentation for that
variable.

11.1.1.3 *DONE* Forking and Pull Requests
.........................................

Default Key   Description
----------------------------------------------
‘H f’         Fork the current repository
‘H p’         Submit pull requests upstream

   You can also filter pull requests with
‘magithub-issue-pull-request-filter-functions’.  See the section on
issue-filtering for an example.

11.1.1.4 *TODO* Labels
......................

Default Key                          Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‘M-x magithub-label-color-replace’   Choose a new color for the label at point

   By default, Magithub will adopt the color used by GitHub when showing
labels.  In some themes, this doesn’t provide enough contrast.  Use ‘M-x
magithub-label-color-replace’ to replace the current label’s color with
another one.  (This will apply to all labels in all repositories, but
will of course not apply to all _shades_ of the original color.)


File: magithub.info,  Node: Status Checks,  Prev: Labels,  Up: Working with Repositories

11.1.1.5 *TODO* Status Checks
.............................

Default Key   Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------
‘RET’         Visit the status’s dashboard in your browser
‘TAB’         On the status header, show individual CI details
‘H ~’         Toggle status integration for this repository

   When the status buffer first opens, the status header is inserted at
the top and probably looks something like this:
     Status:   Success

   You can get a breakdown of which checks succeeded and which failed by
using ‘TAB’:
     Status:   Success
               Checks for ref: develop
               Success The Travis CI build passed continuous-integration/travis-ci/push

   Pressing ‘RET’ on the header will take you to the dashboard
associated with that status check.  If there’s more than one status
check here, you’ll be prompted to choose a check (e.g., Travis, Circle,
CLA, ...).  Of course, if you expand the header to show the individual
checks, ‘RET’ on those will take you straight to that check.

11.2 *TODO* ’Tricks’
====================

Most of Magithub is implemented in pure Elisp now, but there are a few
lingering goodies that haven’t been ported (since their real logic is
non-trivial).  These definitions are relegated to
‘magithub-issue-tricks.el’.

   Make sure to install ‘hub’ (https://hub.github.com) and add it to
your ‘exec-path’ if you intend to use these functions.  After
installation, use ‘hub browse’ from a directory with a GitHub repository
to force the program to authenticate – this avoids some weirdness on the
Emacs side of things.
