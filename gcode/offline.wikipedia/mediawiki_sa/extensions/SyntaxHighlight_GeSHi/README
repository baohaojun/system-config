This README file might be out of date, have a look at the extension page
for updated informations:

    http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi

== Requirements ==

This version of the extension has been tested with GeSHi 1.0.8.10 and MediaWiki 1.18
as of 2011-02-19. It may or may not work with earlier versions of the aforementioned
software. To get releases of this extension compatible with earlier versions of
MediaWiki, visit: 

    http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:ExtensionDistributor/SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi


== Installation ==

If you downloaded this from MediaWiki.org, there should already be
a 'geshi' directory in this folder. If there is, you can skip the next
paragraph.

Download the latest stable build from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114997, and unzip it into
your extensions/SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi/ directory. (Note: the zip file creates a 
sub-directory called geshi/, and places a file geshi.php there)

Add this line to your LocalSettings.php:

	require_once("extensions/SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi/SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi.php");

If your MediaWiki software is obtained via Subversion, then the latest build 
can be downloaded via the Subversion repository. First of all, is to switch 
into your extensions/SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi/ directory. Then invoke the command 
to obtain the latest build of the GeSHi code:

	svn checkout https://geshi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geshi/trunk/geshi-1.0.X/src/ geshi

If needed, change the following line on SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi.class.php to 
suit the path of your geshi.php file
    
	require_once( 'geshi/geshi.php' );

== Usage ==

On the wiki page, you can now use "source" elements:

<source lang="php">
<?php
    v = "string";    // sample initialization
?>
html text
<?php
    echo v;         // end of php code
?>
</source>
