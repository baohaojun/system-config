     Public Domain Icons

     These icons were originally made for Mosaic for X and have been
     included in the NCSA httpd and Apache server distributions in the
     past. They are in the public domain and may be freely included in any
     application. The originals were done by Kevin Hughes (kevinh@eit.com).

     Many thanks to Andy Polyakov for tuning the icon colors and adding a
     few new images. If you'd like to contribute additions or ideas to
     this set, please let me know.

     The distribution site for these icons is at:
