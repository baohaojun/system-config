1 Overview of this tool
***********************

1.1 What is GNU GLOBAL?
=======================

GNU GLOBAL is a source code tag system that works the same way across
diverse environments such as Emacs editor, Vi editor, Less viewer, Bash
shell, various web browsers, etc.  You can locate specified objects
such as functions, macros, structs, classes in your source files and
move there easily.  It is useful for hacking large projects which
contain many sub-directories, many `#ifdef' and many `main()' functions.
It is similar to ctags or etags, but is different from them at the
point of independence of any editor.

1.2 Concept of project
======================

GNU GLOBAL can treat a source tree containing sub-directories as a
project.  Anywhere in the project, you can utilize high performance tag
database.  You need not specify where the database is.  Instead,
global(1) locates it by itself.  Because of this feature, you can move
freely in a project, and in and out of many projects.

1.3 Features
============

GNU GLOBAL has following features:

   * support C, C++, Yacc, Java, PHP4 and assembly.

   * work the same way across diverse environments like follows:


        - Shell command line

        - Bash shell

        - Vi editor (Nvi, Elvis, vim)

        - Less viewer

        - Emacs editor (Emacs, Mule, Xemacs)

        - Web browser

        - Doxygen documentation system

   * find the locations of specified object quickly.

   * locate not only object definitions but also object references.

   * allows duplicate objects.

   * locate path names which include specified pattern.

   * hierarchical search is available.

   * search not only in a source project but also in library projects.

   * generate completion list for completing input method.

   * support various output format.

   * allows customizing of the set of candidate files to be tagged.

   * understand POSIX 1003.2 regular expression.

   * support idutils as an external search engine.

   * tag files are independent of machine architecture.

   * support incremental updating of tag files.

   * plug-in parser is available to treat new language.

   * support customizing with `gtags.conf'.

   * generate a hypertext of source code.

2.1 Preparation
===============

Before beginning, please read the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) file.

   $ more /usr/local/share/gtags/FAQ

   First of all, you must execute gtags(1)(*note gtags::) at the root
of source tree.  For example, if you want to browse the source code of
Vi editor in FreeBSD, please move to the source directory and invoke
gtags(1).


         $ cd /usr/src/usr.bin/vi
         $ gtags

   Gtags traverses sub-directories, picks up source files and makes
four tag files at the current directory.  After this, the whole files
under this directory is treated as a project.


         $ ls G*
         GPATH   GRTAGS  GTAGS

   * `GTAGS'         definition database

   * `GRTAGS'         reference database

   * `GPATH'         path name database

   You should prepare for considerable disk space for the tag files.
For example, Linux-2.6.32 source code requires the following disk space.

         source code(Linux-2.6.32)       390MB

         GPATH                             6MB
         GTAGS                            81MB
         GRTAGS                          202MB
         -------------------------------------
         total of tag files              289MB

2.2 Basic usage
===============

Consider the following source tree:


     /home/user/
      |
      |-ROOT/      <- the root of source tree (GTAGS,GRTAGS,...)
         |
         |- README       .....   +---------------+
         |                       |The function of|
         |                       +---------------+
         |- DIR1/
         |  |
         |  |- fileA.c   .....   +---------------+
         |  |                    |main(){        |
         |  |                    |       func1();|
         |  |                    |       func2();|
         |  |                    |}              |
         |  |                    +---------------+
         |  |
         |  |- fileB.c   .....   +---------------+
         |                       |func1(){ ... } |
         |                       +---------------+
         |- DIR2/
            |
            |- fileC.c   .....   +---------------+
                                 |#ifdef X       |
                                 |func2(){ i++; }|
                                 |#else          |
                                 |func2(){ i--; }|
                                 |#endif         |
                                 |func3(){       |
                                 |       func1();|
                                 |}              |
                                 +---------------+

   * Once you make tag files at the root directory of the source tree,
     you can execute global(1) from anywhere in the tree.  By default,
     you get the relative path of the located files.  You need not
     specify where the tag file is. Instead, global(1) locates it by
     itself.


              $ cd /home/user/ROOT
              $ global func1
              DIR1/fileB.c            # func1() is defined in fileB.c
              $ cd DIR1
              $ global func1
              fileB.c                 # relative path from DIR1
              $ cd ../DIR2
              $ global func1
              ../DIR1/fileB.c         # relative path from DIR2

     Global command is possible to use only when you are in a project.
     If you are out of any project, it brings an error message like
     follows:


              $ cd /home/user
              $ global func1
              global: GTAGS not found.

   * The `-r' option locates object references.  


              $ global -r func2
              ../DIR1/fileA.c         # func2() is referred from fileA.c

   * You can use POSIX regular expressions.


              $ cd /home/user/ROOT
              $ global 'func[1-3]'
              DIR1/fileB.c            # func1, func2 and func3 are matched
              DIR2/fileC.c

   * The `-x' option shows the details.  It is similar to the `-x'
     option in ctags(1).  


              $ global func2
              DIR2/fileC.c
              $ global -x func2
              func2              2 DIR2/fileC.c       func2(){ i++; }
              func2              4 DIR2/fileC.c       func2(){ i--; }

   * The `-a' option produces the absolute path name.  


              $ global -a func1
              /home/user/ROOT/DIR1/fileB.c

   * The `-s' command locates symbols which are not defined in `GTAGS'.  


              $ global -xs X
              X                  1 DIR2/fileC.c #ifdef X

   * The `-g' command locates the lines which have specified pattern.  


              $ global -xg '#ifdef'
              #ifdef             1 DIR2/fileC.c #ifdef X

     It is similar to egrep(1) but is far more convenient for source
     code reading, because it allows you to search through a project,
     and only in the source files.

     Additionally, you can use various options:
    `-O'
          search only in the text files.

    `-o'
          search in both the source files and text files.

    `-l'
          search only under the current directory.

     The `-e', `-G' and `-i' options are available too.  The usage is
     the same as egrep(1).

     You can even change the output format of global(1) to the grep
     style using the `--result=grep' option.  Of course, these options
     can be used even by other commands.

   * The `-P' command locates path names which include specified
     pattern.  


              $ global -P fileB
              DIR1/fileB.c
              $ global -P '1/'
              DIR1/fileA.c
              DIR1/fileB.c
              $ global -P '\.c$'
              DIR1/fileA.c
              DIR1/fileB.c
              DIR2/fileC.c

   * The `-f' command print a list of objects in specified file.  


              $ global -f DIR2/fileC.c
              func2              2 DIR2/fileC.c   func2(){ i++; }
              func2              4 DIR2/fileC.c   func2(){ i--; }
              func3              6 DIR2/fileC.c   func3(){

   * The `-l' option limits the range of the retrieval under the
     current directory.  

              $ cd DIR1
              $ global -xl func[1-3]
              func1        1 fileB.c      func1(){...}

2.3 Applied usage
=================

   * You can customize a set of candidate files to be tagged.  


              $ find . -type f -print >/tmp/list     # make a file set
              $ vi /tmp/list                         # customize the file set
              $ gtags -f /tmp/list

   * If your source files are on a read-only device, such as CDROM,
     then you cannot make tag files at the root of the source tree.  In
     such case, you can make tag files in another place using the
     `GTAGSROOT' environment variable.


              $ mkdir /var/dbpath
              $ cd /cdrom/src                 # the root of source tree
              $ gtags /var/dbpath             # make tag files in /var/dbpath
              $ export GTAGSROOT=`pwd`
              $ export GTAGSDBPATH=/var/dbpath
              $ global func

     There is another method for it. Since global(1) locates tag files
     also in `/usr/obj' + <current directory>, you can setup like
     follows:


              $ cd /cdrom/src                 # the root of source tree
              $ mkdir -p /usr/obj/cdrom/src
              $ gtags /usr/obj/cdrom/src      # make tag files in /usr/obj/cdrom/src
              $ global func

     The value `/usr/obj' can be changed by environment variable
     `MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX'.  The `-O, --objdir' option do it automatically
     instead of you.  

   * If you want to locate objects that are not defined in the source
     tree, then you can specify library directories with the
     `GTAGSLIBPATH' environment variable.

     You should execute gtags at each directory of the path.  If
     `GTAGS' is not found there, global ignores it.


              $ pwd
              /develop/src/mh                         # this is a source project
              $ gtags
              $ ls G*TAGS
              GRTAGS  GTAGS
              $ global mhl
              uip/mhlsbr.c                            # mhl() is found
              $ global strlen                         # strlen() is not found
              $ (cd /usr/src/lib; gtags)              # library source
              $ (cd /usr/src/sys; gtags)              # kernel source
              $ export GTAGSLIBPATH=/usr/src/lib:/usr/src/sys
              $ global strlen
              ../../../usr/src/lib/libc/string/strlen.c  # found in library
              $ global access
              ../../../usr/src/sys/kern/vfs_syscalls.c   # found in kernel

     Or, you can take a more straightforward way to do the same thing.
     In the following example, we treat as if the system library and
     the kernel are part of our project.


              $ ln -s /usr/src/lib .
              $ ln -s /usr/src/sys .
              $ gtags
              $ global strlen
              lib/libc/string/strlen.c
              $ global access
              sys/kern/vfs_syscalls.c

   * If you forget object names, you can use the `-c' (complete)
     command.  


              $ global -c kmem                # maybe k..k.. kmem..
              kmem_alloc
              kmem_alloc_pageable
              kmem_alloc_wait
              kmem_free
              kmem_free_wakeup
              kmem_init
              kmem_malloc
              kmem_suballoc                   # This is what I need!
              $ global kmem_suballoc
              ../vm/vm_kern.c

   * You can use the `-c' command with the complete command in the
     shell.

     In Bash:

              $ funcs()
              > {
              >         local cur
              >         cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
              >         COMPREPLY=(`global -c $cur`)
              > }
              $ complete -F funcs global
              $ global kmem_TABTAB
              kmem_alloc           kmem_alloc_wait      kmem_init
              kmem_alloc_nofault   kmem_free            kmem_malloc
              kmem_alloc_pageable  kmem_free_wakeup     kmem_suballoc
              $ global kmem_sTAB
              $ global kmem_suballoc
              ../vm/vm_kern.c

     In Tcsh:

              % set funcs=(`global -c`)
              % complete global 'n/*/$funcs/'
              % global kmem_TAB
              kmem_alloc          kmem_free_wakeup
              kmem_alloc_pageable kmem_init
              kmem_alloc_wait     kmem_malloc
              kmem_free           kmem_suballoc
              % global kmem_sTAB
              % global kmem_suballoc
              ../vm/vm_kern.c

     If you like input completion, you had better try globash(*note
     GloBash::).  It support you in a suitable way without any
     preparation.

   * You can edit all files which have specified objects by typing one
     command, for example:


              $ vi `global func1`     # edit fileB.c

   * If you want to browse many files in order, do the following:


              $ global -xr fork | awk '{printf "view +%s %s\n",$2,$3}'
              view +650 ../dev/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_asm.c
              view +250 ibcs2/ibcs2_misc.c
              view +401 linux/linux_misc.c
              view +310 ../kern/init_main.c
              view +318 ../kern/init_main.c
              view +336 ../kern/init_main.c
              view +351 ../kern/init_main.c
              $ !! | sh            # from now on, go to next tag with 'ZZ'.

3.1.2 Preparation
-----------------

First, do the preparation of global. *Note Preparation::.  And you can
invoke globash(1) command.

         $ globash

   Only first time, you will see the following message.

         GloBash needs a working directory. Do you create '/home/you/.globash'? ([y]/n)

   Inputing the ENTER key, you will see a prompt like this:


         [/usr/src/sys]/kern _

   This prompt means that the current directory is '/usr/src/sys/kern'
and the root directory of the project is '/usr/src/sys'.  Tag and
marker are valid only in a project.

   When you try to go out of the project, globash warns like:

         [/usr/src/sys] cd ..
         You are going to get out of the current project.
         Tag stack and marker will be removed. Sure? ([y]/n)_

   If you answer `y' and `RET' or just `RET' in the above prompt then
the tag stack and marker (described later) will be removed.

   If you need help then please type `ghelp'.

3.1.3 Usage
-----------

   * Almost global(1)(*note global::)'s command characters are
     available as a command.

              [/usr/src/sys] x fork               <- (global -x fork)
              >    1  fork              94 kern/kern_fork.c fork(p, uap)
              [/usr/src/sys] r                    <- (global -xr fork)
              >    1  fork              85 alpha/linux/linux_machdep.c
                   2  fork             184 i386/linux/linux_machdep.c
              [/usr/src/sys] s lbolt              <- (global -xs lbolt)
              >    1  lbolt            1210 i386/isa/wd_cd.c     tsleep((cad

              [/usr/src/sys] g                    <- (global -xg lbolt)
              >    1  lbolt            1210 i386/isa/wd_cd.c     tsleep((cad
              ...
              [/usr/src/sys] P init               <- (global -xP init)
              >    1  path    1 dev/hea/eni_init.c

                   4  path    1 kern/init_main.c
                   5  path    1 kern/init_sysent.c
                   6  path    1 kern/vfs_init.c
                   7  path    1 vm/vm_init.c
              [/usr/src/sys] _

     If no argument is specified then the latest argument is used.

   * Input completion facility is available. For each command, suitable
     completion is applied.

              [/usr/src/sys] x kmem_TABTAB
              kmem_alloc          kmem_free           kmem_malloc
              kmem_alloc_nofault  kmem_free_wakeup    kmem_object
              kmem_alloc_wait     kmem_init           kmem_suballoc
              [/usr/src/sys] x kmem_sTAB
              [/usr/src/sys] x kmem_suballoc

   * You can select a tag by the `show' command.

              [/usr/src/sys] x main
              >    1  main              70 alpha/alpha/gensetdefs.c main(in
                   2  main             1500 alpha/alpha/ieee_float.c main(i
                   3  main             227 boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c main()
              ....
              [/usr/src/sys] show 3
              (Load editor and show boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c at line 227.)

     The default editor is vi(1) but you can specify it statically by
     `EDITOR' environment variable or temporarily by options.


              [/usr/src/sys] show -e 3
              (Preloaded emacs show boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c at line 227.)
              [/usr/src/sys] show -l 3
              (Load less and show boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c at line 227.)
              [/usr/src/sys] show -g 3
              (Preloaded mozilla show boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c at line 227.)

     Otherwise, you can use the following commands (and abbreviated
     form):
    `list (l)'
          print tag list.

    `first'
          go to the first tag.

    `last'
          go to the last tag.

    `next (n)'
          go to next tag.

    `prev (p)'
          go to previous tag.

    `show n (1,2,3,..,999)'
          go to nth tag

   * You can use vi-like tag stack. You can return the previous tag list
     by the `pop' or `CTL-T' command.

              [/usr/src/sys] x main
              >    1  main              70 alpha/alpha/gensetdefs.c main(in
                   2  main             1500 alpha/alpha/ieee_float.c main(i
                   3  main             227 boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c main()
              ....
              [/usr/src/sys] show 3
              (Load editor and show boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c at line 227.)
              [/usr/src/sys] x fork          <- push new tag on the tag stack.
              >    1  fork              94 kern/kern_fork.c fork(p, uap)
              [/usr/src/sys] pop             <- pop tag stack.
              [/usr/src/sys] show
              (Load editor and show boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c at line 227.)

     You can print the tag stack by `tags' command.

   * You can memory tags using the `mark' command.

              [/usr/src/sys] x fork
              >    1  fork              94 kern/kern_fork.c fork(p, uap)
              [/usr/src/sys] mark
              [/usr/src/sys] x main
              >    1  main              70 alpha/alpha/gensetdefs.c main(in
                   2  main             1500 alpha/alpha/ieee_float.c main(i
                   3  main             227 boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c main()
              ....
              [/usr/src/sys] mark -l              <- show marker list.
                   1  fork              94 kern/kern_fork.c fork(p, uap)
              [/usr/src/sys] mark 1               <- select a marker.
              (Load editor and show kern/kern_fork.c at line 227.)
              [/usr/src/sys] list
              >    1  main              70 alpha/alpha/gensetdefs.c main(in
                   2  main             1500 alpha/alpha/ieee_float.c main(i
                   3  main             227 boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c main()
              ....

     Marked tags are valid until you go out of the current project or
     quit the current Bash session.

   * You can memory directories using the `cookie' command, and return
     there using the `warp' command.

              [/usr/src/sys] cookie               <- drop a cookie.
              [/usr/src/sys] cd kern
              [/usr/src/sys]/kern cookie          <- drop a cookie again.
              [/usr/src/sys]/kern cd ../i386
              [/usr/src/sys]/i386 cookie -l       <- show cookie list.
                   1  /usr/src/sys/kern
                   2  /usr/src/sys
              [/usr/src/sys]/i386 warp 2          <- warp to the selected cookie.
              [/usr/src/sys] _

     Cookie directories are valid until you delete them.

3.2 Less using GLOBAL
=====================

You can use GLOBAL as the tag system of Less(1) viewer instead of ctags.

* Menu:

* Features(Less)::                       Features.
* Preparation(Less)::                    Preparation.

File: global.info,  Node: Features(Less),  Next: Preparation(Less),  Up: Less viewer

3.2.1 Features
--------------

   * You can use most of GLOBAL's facilities from Less viewer.

   * Less viewer support duplicated tag.


File: global.info,  Node: Preparation(Less),  Next: Usage(Less),  Prev: Features(Less),  Up: Less viewer

3.2.2 Preparation
-----------------

First, do the preparation of global. *Note Preparation::.

   Second, to use global from Less, you need to set environment variable
`LESSGLOBALTAGS' to "global".


         $ export LESSGLOBALTAGS=global


File: global.info,  Node: Usage(Less),  Prev: Preparation(Less),  Up: Less viewer

3.2.3 Usage
-----------

   * To go to func1, you can say

              $ less -t func1

     Please note that if `tags' exists in the current directory then
     Less use it.  If you want to use `GTAGS' even if `tags' exists
     then please specify the tag file explicitly like this:


              $ less -TGTAGS -t func1

   * To go to the referenced point of func1, please specify `GRTAGS'.

              $ less -TGRTAGS -t func1

     In the same way, you can use `GTAGS', `GRTAGS', `GPATH' as tag
     files.

   * If a number of objects are located, Less goes to the first tag.
     You can go to next tag by typing `t' and back by typing `T'.

    `t'
          go to next tag.

    `T'
          go to previous tag.

   * In a Less session, you can use `:t' command to locate new symbol.
     But in this case, you cannot change tag file from one specified by
     `-T' option.

   * With the `-T-' option, Less read standard input as a tag file.
     You can connect global and Less with a pipe. It is very convenient.


              $ global -x func | less -T-

     In the same way, you can use the following command lines:


              # pattern match with grep(1).
              $ global -xg 'lseek(.*)' | less -T-

              # pattern match with idutils(1).
              $ global -xI func | less -T-

              # all objects definitions in *.c.
              $ global -f *.c | less -T-

              # all files includes 'init' in its path.
              $ global -Px init | less -T-

   * If your editor doesn't support GLOBAL directly then you can use
     Less as a footstool.


              # invoke less
              $ less -t main
              main(int argc, char **argv)
              {
              int i;
              .....
              [xxx/main.c (tag 1 of 55)]

              # type 'v'(vi) command in less session.
              v

              # load vi and show the same position.
              .....
              main((int argc, char **argv)
              {
              int i;
              .....
              [xxx/main.c 313 lines, 7783 char]

              # type 'ZZ' command in vi session.
              ZZ

              # exit vi and back to less session.
              main(int argc, char **argv)
              {
              int i;
              .....
              [xxx/main.c (tag 1 of 55)]

3.3.2 Preparation
-----------------

First, do the preparation of global. *Note Preparation::.

   Second, to use global from Nvi, you need write to `.nexrc' like this:
It assumed that `gtags.pl' is put on `$HOME/perl'.


         $HOME/.nexrc
         +----------------------------
         |perl use lib "$ENV{'HOME'}/perl"
         |perl require 'gtags.pl'
         |map ^P :tagprev^M
         |map ^N :tagnext^M
         |map ^] :perl tag^M
         |ab gtag perl tag qw(
         |ab gta perl tag qw(
         |ab gt perl tag qw(

   You must start Nvi in a project described in *Note Preparation::.


File: global.info,  Node: Usage(Nvi-1.81.5),  Prev: Preparation(Nvi-1.81.5),  Up: Nvi-1.81.5 editor

3.3.3 Usage
-----------

   * To go to func1, you can say

              :perl tag qw(func1)


              Suggested .nexrc:
              ab gtag perl tag qw(
              ab gta perl tag qw(
              ab gt perl tag qw(

   * To go to the referenced point of func1, add the option `-r'

              :perl tag qw(-r func1)

   * If a number of objects are located, Nvi goes to the first tag.
     You can go to next tag by typing `:tagnext' and back by typing
     `:tagprev'.


              Suggested .nexrc:
              map ^N :tagnext^M
              map ^P :tagprev^M

   * If you don't specify any argument. ':perl tag' command do the
     followings:

     If the context of the current token is a definition then it is
     equivalent to `:perl tag qw(-r CURRENT TOKEN)'.  Otherwise, if it
     is a reference to some definitions then it is equivalent to `:perl
     tag qw(CURRENT TOKEN)' else it is equivalent to `:perl tag qw(-s
     CURRENT TOKEN)'.


              Suggested .nexrc:
              map ^] :perl tag^M

     It is similar to `CTL-]' command.

   * You can use the `-s' option. It locates symbols which are not
     defined in `GTAGS'.

              :perl tag qw(-s pat)

   * The `-g', `-f' and `-P' option are also available.  It works like
     command line.

              :perl tag qw(-g pat)

   * When you want to locate objects the name of which start with "set"
     or "get", use:

              :perl tag qw(^[sg]et)

   * Other tag commands are also available:
    `CTL-T'
          returns to the most recent tag location.

    `:tagpop'
          returns to the most recent tag location.

    `:tagtop'
          returns to the top of the tag stack.

    `:display tags'
          display the tags stack.

3.4.2 Preparation
-----------------

First, do the preparation of global. *Note Preparation::.

   Second, start Elvis and execute `set tagprg="global -t $1"' like
this: 


         $ elvis
         ~
         ~
         ~
         ~
         ~
         ~
         :set tagprg="global -t $1"


File: global.info,  Node: Usage(Elvis),  Prev: Preparation(Elvis),  Up: Elvis editor

3.4.3 Usage
-----------

   * To go to func1, you can say

              :tag func1

     It seems same as original Elvis, but Elvis execute `global -t
     func1' internally and read the output instead of tags file.

   * To go to the referenced point of func1, add `-r' option.  

              :tag -r func1

   * To locate symbols which are not defined in `GTAGS', try this.  

              :tag -s lbolt

   * To locate strings, try this.  

              :tag -g Copyright

   * When a lot of results are expected, you had better use the browse
     command.

              :browse -r fork

     It brings a following selection list. You can select a tag line
     and go to the point.


              Browse -r fork (2 matches)
              +----------------+----------------+--------------------
              | TAG NAME       | SOURCE FILE    | SOURCE LINE
              +----------------+----------------+--------------------
              |fork            |ux/linux_misc.c | (line 565)
              |fork            |ern/init_main.c | (line 191)
              +----------------+----------------+--------------------

   * To get a list of objects in specified files, use `-f' command.  

              :browse -f main.c               <- locate definitions in main.c

   * Other tag commands are also available:

    `CTL-]'
          go to the definition of current token.

    `CTL-T'
          return to the most recent tag context.

    `:tag'
          without argument, go to the next tag.

    `:pop'
          return to the most recent tag context.

    `:stack'
          display the tags stack.

    `:stag'
          creates a new window and moves its cursor to the tag's
          definition point.

    `:sbrowse'
          same with `browse' but show in a new window.

   * You can use POSIX regular expressions.  

              :tag ^put_                  <- locate objects start with 'put_'

              :browse -g 'fseek(.*L_SET)' <- locate fseek() using L_SET argument

   * You can browse an object list of many files.  

              :browse -f *.c              <- locate objects in *.c

   * You can browse the files whose path includes specified pattern.  

              :browse -P /vm/             <- under vm/ directory
              :browse -P \.h$             <- all include files
              :browse -P init             <- path including 'init'

   * You can use mouse for tag operations.

     If you have a mouse, then you can use the left button to
     double-click on a word in the text, to have Elvis perform a `:tag'
     search on that word.  Double-clicking the right button anywhere in
     the text will perform a `:pop' command.

     In the selection list by the `browse' command, you can use the
     left button to double-click on a tag name, to have Elvis select
     the tag.  To come back, double-click on the right button.

3.5 Vim using GLOBAL
====================

In Vim 6.2 or later, you can use `gtags.vim' script.

* Menu:

* Features(Vim)::                       Features.
* Preparation(Vim)::                    Preparation.
* Usage(Vim)::                          Usage.


File: global.info,  Node: Features(Vim),  Next: Preparation(Vim),  Up: Vim editor

3.5.1 Features
--------------

   * You can use most of GLOBAL's facilities from Vim.

   * Intelligent recognition of the current token and its type.

   * Special character '%', '#' and input completion are available.

   To our regret, tag stack facility is not available.  If you want to
use the facility, please try gtags-cscope *Note Gtags-cscope (fake
cscope)::.


File: global.info,  Node: Preparation(Vim),  Next: Usage(Vim),  Prev: Features(Vim),  Up: Vim editor

3.5.2 Preparation
-----------------

First, do the preparation of global. *Note Preparation::.

   Second, copy `gtags.vim' to your plug-in directory or source it from
your vimrc.


         $ cp /usr/local/share/gtags/gtags.vim $HOME/.vim/plugin


File: global.info,  Node: Usage(Vim),  Prev: Preparation(Vim),  Up: Vim editor

3.5.3 Usage
-----------

   * To go to main, you can say

              :Gtags main

     Vim execute global(1), parse the output, list located objects in
     quickfix window and load the first entry.  The quickfix windows is
     like this:

          gozilla/gozilla.c|200| main(int argc, char **argv)
          gtags-cscope/gtags-cscope.c|124| main(int argc, char **argv)
          gtags-parser/asm_scan.c|2056| int main()
          gtags-parser/gctags.c|157| main(int argc, char **argv)
          gtags-parser/php.c|2116| int main()
          gtags/gtags.c|152| main(int argc, char **argv)
          [Quickfix List]

     You can go to any entry using quickfix command.

    `:cn'
          go to the next entry.

    `:cp'
          go to the previous entry.

    `:ccN'
          go to the N'th entry.

    `:cl'
          list all entries.

     You can see the help of quickfix like this:

              :h quickfix

              Suggested map:
              map <C-n> :cn<CR>
              map <C-p> :cp<CR>

   * To go to the referenced point of func1, add `-r' option.  

              :Gtags -r func1

   * To locate symbols which are not defined in `GTAGS', try this.  

              :Gtags -s lbolt

   * To locate strings, try this.  

              :Gtags -g int argc

              :Gtags -g "root"

              :Gtags -ge -C		<- locate '-C'

   * To get a list of objects in specified files, use -f command.  

              :Gtags -f main.c               <- locate objects in main.c

     If you are editing `main.c' itself, you can use '%' instead.

              :Gtags -f %                    <- locate objects in main.c

   * You can use POSIX regular expressions.  

              :Gtags ^put_                <- locate objects start with 'put_'

              :Gtags -g fseek(.*SEEK_SET) <- locate fseek() using SEEK_SET

   * Input completion is available.

     In the command line, press `CTL-D' after some typings and Vim will
     show a list of tag names that start with the string.  Press `TAB'
     and Vim will complete the tag name.

              :Gtags fuTAB

              :Gtags func1               <- 'nc1' is appended by vim

   * You can browse files whose path includes specified pattern.  


              :Gtags -P /vm/             <- under vm/ directory
              :Gtags -P \.h$             <- all include files
              :Gtags -P init             <- path including 'init'

   * You can use all options of global(1) except for the -c, -n, -p,
     -q, -u, -v and 	all long name options. They are sent to global(1)
     as is.  	For example,


              :Gtags -gi paTtern    <- match to both 'PATTERN' and 'pattern'.

              :Gtags -POi make      <- match to Makefile but doesn't match to makeit.c.
     	About the other options, please see *Note global::.

   * The GtagsCursor command brings you to the definition or reference
     of the current token.

     	If the context of the current token is a definition then it is
     equivalent to 	`:Gtags -r CURRENT TOKEN'.  	Otherwise, if it
     is a reference to some definitions then it is equivalent to
     `:Gtags CURRENT TOKEN' else it is equivalent 	to `:Gtags -s CURRENT
     TOKEN'.


              :GtagsCursor


              Suggested map:
              map <C-\>^] :GtagsCursor<CR>

     Though the mapping ':GtagsCursor' to '^]' seems suitable, it will
     bring an inconvenience in the help screen.

   * If you have the hypertext generated by htags(1) then you can
     display 	the same part of the source code on the mozilla
     browser.  	Let's load mozilla and try this:


              :Gozilla


              Suggested map:
              map <C-g> :Gozilla<CR>

   * If you want to load Vim with all main()s then following command
     line is useful.


              $ vim '+Gtags main'

3.6 Extended Emacs using GLOBAL
===============================

You can use GLOBAL as the tag system of Emacs editor instead of etags.

* Menu:

* Features(Emacs)::			Features.
* Preparation(Emacs)::                  Preparation.
* Usage(Emacs)::                        Usage.


File: global.info,  Node: Features(Emacs),  Next: Preparation(Emacs),  Up: Emacs editor

3.6.1 Features
--------------

   * You can use most of GLOBAL's facilities from the editor.

   * More intelligent recognition of the current token and its type.

   * Tag completion is available for input tag name.

   * Mouse is supported.


File: global.info,  Node: Preparation(Emacs),  Next: Usage(Emacs),  Prev: Features(Emacs),  Up: Emacs editor

3.6.2 Preparation
-----------------

First, do the preparation of global. *Note Preparation::.

   Second, to use global from Emacs, you need to load the `gtags.el'
and execute gtags-mode function in it.

   Write the call to autoload function to your `$HOME/.emacs', start
Emacs and execute gtags-mode function.  If you put `gtags.el' in a
directory other than the standard macro directory, you need to add it
to `load-path'.


         $HOME/.emacs
         +------------------------------------------------------
         |(setq load-path (cons "/home/owner/global" load-path))
         |(autoload 'gtags-mode "gtags" "" t)

         $ emacs

         |
         |J_:-----Mule: *scratch*       (Lisp Interaction)--L16--All----
         |M-x gtags-mode[RET]
         +------------------------------------------------------

   If you want to get into gtags-mode whenever you get into c-mode then
you can append the following code to your `$HOME/.emacs'.


           (setq c-mode-hook
               '(lambda ()
                   (gtags-mode 1)
           ))


File: global.info,  Node: Usage(Emacs),  Prev: Preparation(Emacs),  Up: Emacs editor

3.6.3 Usage
-----------

   * To go to func1, invoke `gtags-find-tag' and you can see a prompt
     in the mini-buffer. Then input the tag name.

              Find tag: func1			<- 'Find tag: ' is a prompt

   * To go to the referenced point of func1, invoke `gtags-find-rtag'.


              Find tag (reference): func1

   * Tag name completion is available.       You need to execute
     `gtags-make-complete-list' command before it.


              Find tag: fuTAB

              Find tag: func1                     <- 'nc1' is appended by emacs

   * If a number of objects are located, Emacs goes into "GTAGS SELECT
     MODE" like this:


              +-------------------------------------------------------------
              |main             347 i386/isa/ultra14f.c main()
              |main             128 kern/init_main.c   main(framep)
              |main             104 netiso/clnp_debug.c main()
              |main             164 netiso/xebec/main.c main(argc, argv)
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |J_:--%*-Mule: *scratch*       (Gtags Select)--L1--All----
              |[GTAGS SELECT MODE] 4 lines
              +-------------------------------------------------------------

     Please select a tag line by any Emacs command and press `RET', and
     you can go to the tag's point. When you want to go to the next or
     the previous tag, please return to the above mode with
     `gtags-pop-stack' and reselect.

     You can customize the path style in this mode by setting
     `gtags-path-style' variable.

    ``root''
          relative from the root of the project (Default)

    ``relative''
          relative from the current directory

    ``absolute''
          absolute (relative from the system root directory)

     There are two method to set this variable:
        * You can change it dynamically using the `customize' command
          of Emacs.

          You will find the entry in the Programming/Tools/Gtags group.

        * You can change it when Emacs is loaded using `.emacs' file
          like this:


                   (setq gtags-mode-hook
                     '(lambda ()
                       (setq gtags-path-style 'relative)))

   * `gtags-find-tag-from-here' command is available.

     If current token is a definition, it is equivalent to `Find tag
     (reference): CURRENT TOKENRET', otherwise it is equivalent to
     `Find tag: CURRENT TOKENRET'.

   * To locate symbols which are not defined in `GTAGS', try
     `gtags-find-symbol'.

              Find symbol: lbolt		<- 'Find symbol:' is a prompt

   * To locate strings, try `gtags-find-with-grep'.

              Find pattern: Copyright

   * You can use POSIX regular expressions.


              Find tag: ^put_                 <- locate tags start with 'put_'

   * Mouse command is available.

     If you use X version Emacs, try the following:

     Move the mouse cursor to an object name and click the middle
     button, and you can go to the point of the definitions, or to its
     references, depending on the context. In 'GTAGS SELECT MODE', move
     the mouse cursor to a line and click the center button.

     To return to the previous position, click the right button.

3.7 Gtags-cscope (fake cscope)
==============================

You can use gtags-cscope(1) instead of cscope(1).  For example, you can
deceive Vim editor using the following commands:


     :set csprg=gtags-cscope
     :cs add GTAGS

   After this, you can use built-in 'cs find' commands in the Vim
editor.  Though the deceit is not perfect ('cs find d' is not
implemented), this method might be more convenient than `gtags.vim' in
the point that you can use the tag stack facility of Vim.

3.8 Hypertext generator
=======================

You can use GLOBAL's facilities from web browsers.

* Menu:

* Features(browser)::                   Features.
* Preparation(browser)::                Preparation.
* Usage(browser)::                      Usage.


File: global.info,  Node: Features(browser),  Next: Preparation(browser),  Up: Web browser

3.8.1 Features
--------------

   * Htags makes a hypertext from C, C++, Yacc and Java source files.

   * Once the hypertext is generated, you need nothing other than a web
     browser.

   * You can move the hypertext to anywhere. It is independent of the
     source code.

   * You can use all of your browser's functions, such as search,
     history, bookmark, save, frames, windows, etc.


File: global.info,  Node: Preparation(browser),  Next: Usage(browser),  Prev: Features(browser),  Up: Web browser

3.8.2 Preparation
-----------------

At first, you must ensure that you have a lot of disk space for
hypertext.  For example, Linux-2.6.32 source code (390MB) requires 4-6
G byte of disk space.

         source code(Linux-2.6.32)            390MB
         GPATH,GTAGS,GRTAGS                   289MB

         hypertext (with no option)           3.8GB
         hypertext (with --suggest option)    5.7GB

   Please invoke gtags(1)(*note gtags::) and htags(1)(*note htags::) in
order like this:


         (at the root directory of your source project)
         $ gtags                 # make tag files(GPATH,GTAGS,GRTAGS)
         $ htags                 # make hypertext(HTML/)

   Then you will find a directory named `HTML' in the current directory.

   Htags has rich options. If you are new on htags then you are
recommended to use the `--suggest' option. This option makes some
popular options effective, and invokes gtags(1) if there is no tag
files.


         $ htags --suggest

   If HTTP server is available then the -D and -f option are also
useful.


File: global.info,  Node: Usage(browser),  Prev: Preparation(browser),  Up: Web browser

3.8.3 Usage
-----------

Please start a web browser like this:


         $ lynx HTML/index.html

   You will understand the usage by looking at the examples.

   You can move the HTML directory to anywhere. It is independent of the
source code as long as CGI facility is not used.

   Using mozilla, you can also utilize the hypertext from your command
line like this:


         $ mozilla				# load mozilla
         $ global -x main
         main        10 main.c main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
         $ gozilla +10 main.c		# usage is similar to vi editor.
         (show main.c at 10 on mozilla's screen.)

   But in this case, you must not move the HTML directory from the
source directory.


File: global.info,  Node: Doxygen documentation system,  Prev: Web browser,  Up: Applications

3.9 Doxygen using GLOBAL
========================

You can use GLOBAL as the source browser of Doxygen.

   Doxygen Release 1.4.3 or later has config option USE_HTAGS.  When
enabled in combination with SOURCE_BROWSER=YES, htags(1) is used as the
source browser instead of Doxygen's own.

   Here is an example.


     (in source directory)
     $ doxygen -g
     $ vi Doxyfile
     +---------------------------------
     |...
     |INPUT                  = .
     |RECURSIVE              = YES
     |SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES
     |USE_HTAGS              = YES
     |...

4.1 How to config GLOBAL
========================

You can customize GLOBAL using configuration file.


         # cp gtags.conf /etc/gtags.conf         # system wide config file.
         # vi /etc/gtags.conf

         $ cp gtags.conf $HOME/.globalrc         # personal config file.
         $ vi $HOME/.globalrc

   If `$HOME/.globalrc' exists then GLOBAL use it, else if
`/etc/gtags.conf' exists then GLOBAL use it. Otherwise default value is
used.  The format of `gtags.conf' is resemble to termcap(5). By
default, 'default' target is used.  About the capabilities, please see
each command manual. *Note Reference::.

4.2 Plug-in parser
==================

You can write new parser for gtags(1).

   Command layer plug-in parser was abolished.  Please write function
layer plug-in parser instead.  See `plugin-example/' to know function
layer plug-in parser.


File: global.info,  Node: Incremental updating,  Prev: Plug-in,  Up: Other topics

4.3 Incremental updating
========================

Modifying some source files, you need not remake the whole tag files.
Instead, you can use incremental updating facility (`-u' option).  

         $ gtags
         $ cd kernel
         $ vi user.c                             # modify user.c
         ...
         :wq
         $ global -vu                            # -v means verbose

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Global finds locations of the specified object in C, C++, Yacc, Java,
PHP and Assembly source files, and print the path name, line number and
line image of the locations.  Global can locate not only object
definitions but also object references and other symbols.

   Global can treat a source tree, that is, a directory that has
sub-directories and source files as a project.  In advance of using
this command, you must execute gtags(1) at the root directory of a
project to make tag files.  Then you can execute this command anywhere
in the project.  You need not specify where the tag file is.  Instead,
global locates it by itself.

   You can specify a regular expression for the pattern.  Global
understands two different versions of regular expression syntax: basic
and extended. The default is extended.

COMMANDS
--------

The following commands are available:
<no command> pattern
     Print objects which match to the pattern.  By default, print
     object definitions.

`-c', `--completion' [prefix]
     Print object names which start with the specified prefix.  If
     prefix is not specified, print all object names.

`-f', `--file' files
     Print all objects in the files.  This option implies the `-x'
     option.

`-g', `--grep' pattern [files]
     Print all lines which match to the pattern.  If files is
     specified, this command searchs in the files.

`--help'
     Show help.

`-I', `--idutils' pattern
     Print all lines which match to the pattern.  This function use
     idutils(1) as a search engine.  To use this command, you need to
     install idutils(1) in your system and execute gtags(1) with the
     `-I' option.

`-P', `--path' [pattern]
     Print path names which match to the pattern.  If no pattern
     specified, print all path names in the project.

`-p', `--print-dbpath'
     Print the location of `GTAGS'.

`-u', `--update'
     Update tag files incrementally.  This command internally invokes
     gtags(1).  You can execute this command anywhere in the project
     differing from gtags(1).

`--version'
     Show version number.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options are available:
`-a', `--absolute'
     Print absolute path name. By default, print relative path name.

`--from-here' context
     Decide tag type by the context. The context must be 'lineno:path'.
     If this option is specified then the `-s' and `-r' are ignored.
     Regular expression is not allowed for the pattern.  This option
     assumes use in conversational environments such as editors and
     IDEs.

`-e', `--regexp' pattern
     Use pattern as the pattern; useful to protect patterns beginning
     with `-'.

`--encode-path' chars
     Convert path characters in chars into a '%' symbol, followed by the
     two-digit hexadecimal representation of the character.  A blank
     will be converted to '%20'.

`-G', `--basic-regexp'
     Interpret pattern as a basic regular expression.  The default is
     extended regular expression.

`-i', `--ignore-case'
     Ignore case distinctions in the pattern.

`-l', `--local'
     Print only objects which exist under the current directory.

`-L', `--file-list' file-list
     Obtain files from file-list in addition to the arguments.

`-n', `--nofilter'
     Suppress sort filter and path conversion filter.

`-O', `--only-other'
     Treat only text files other than source code like `README'.  This
     option is valid only with the `-g' or `-P' command.  This option
     override the `-o' option.

`-o', `--other'
     Treat not only source files but also text files other than source
     code like `README'.  This option is valid only with the `-g' or
     `-P' command.

`--print0'
     Print each record followed by a null character instead of a
     newline.

`-q', `--quiet'
     Quiet mode.

`-r', `--reference', `--rootdir'
     Print locations of object references.  With the `-p' option, print
     the root directory of the project.

`--result' format
     Print out using the specified format.  format may be path, ctags,
     ctags-x, grep or cscope.  The default is path.  The
     `--result=ctags' and `--result=ctags-x' are equivalent to the `-t'
     and `-x' respectively.  The `--result' option is given to priority
     more than the -t and -x option.

`-s', `--symbol'
     Print locations of the specified symbol other than definitions.

`-T', `--through'
     Go through all the tag files listed in GTAGSLIBPATH.  By default,
     stop searching when tag is found.  This option is ignored when
     either `-s', `-r' or `-l' option is specified.

`-t', `--tags'
     Use standard ctags format.

`-v', `--verbose'
     Verbose mode.

`-V', `--invert-match'
     Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.  This
     option is valid in the `-g' and `-P' command.

`-x', `--cxref'
     Use standard ctags cxref (with the -x) format.

5.2 gtags - create tag files for global.
========================================

NAME
----

gtags - create tag files for global.

SYNOPSIS
--------



     gtags [-ciIOqvw][-d tag-file][-f file][dbpath]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Gtags is used to create tag files for global(1).

   Gtags recursively collects source files under the current directory,
pickup symbols and write the cross-reference data into the tag files
(`GTAGS', `GRTAGS' and `GPATH').

   If `gtags.files' exists or the `-f' option is specified, target
files are limited by it. Lines starts with ". " are comments.

   C, C++, yacc, java, PHP and Assembly source files are supported.
Files whose names end in `.c' or `.h' are assumed to be C source files.
Files whose names end in `.c++' `.cc' `.cpp' `.cxx' `.hxx' `.hpp' `.C'
`.H' are assumed to be C++ source files.  Files whose names end in `.y'
are assumed to be YACC source files.  Files whose names end in `.java'
are assumed to be Java source files.  Files whose names end in `.php'
`.php3' `.phtml' are assumed to be PHP source files.  Files whose names
end in `.s' or `.S' are assumed to be Assembly source files.  Other
files are assumed to be text files.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options are available:
`-c', `--compact'
     Make GTAGS in compact format.  This option does not influence
     GRTAGS, because they are always made in compact format.

`--config'[=name]
     Print the value of config variable name.  If name is not specified
     then print all names and values.

`-d', `--dump' tag-file
     Dump a tag file. The output format is 'key<tab>data'.  This is for
     debugging.

`-f', `--file' file
     Browse through all source files whose names are listed in file.
     The argument file can  be set to `-' to accept a list of files
     from the standard input.  File names must be separated by newline.

`--gtagsconf' file
     Set the GTAGSCONF environment variable to file.

`--gtagslabel' label
     Set the GTAGSLABEL environment variable to label.

`-I', `--idutils'
     Also make the ID database file for idutils(1).

`-i', `--incremental'
     Update tag files incrementally. You had better use global(1) with
     the -u option.

`-O', `--objdir'
     Use BSD-style objdir as the location of tag files.  If
     `$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX' directory exists, gtags creates
     `$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX/<current directory>' directory and makes tag
     files in it.  If dbpath is specified, this options is ignored.

`--single-update' file
     Update tag files for single file.  It is considered that file was
     updated, and other files were not updated.  The file must be
     relative path name from the current directory.  This option
     implies the -i option.  If the file is new then `--single-update'
     is ignored, and the processing is automatically switched to normal
     incremental updating.

`--statistics'
     Print statistics information.  This option is valid only for
     normal creation of tag files.

`-q', `--quiet'
     Quiet mode.

`-v', `--verbose'
     Verbose mode.

`-w', `--warning'
     Print warning messages.

dbpath
     The directory in which tag files are generated.  The default is
     the current directory.

EXAMPLES
--------

     	$ ls -F
     	Makefile      src/    lib/
     	$ gtags -v
     	$ global -x main
     	main              10 src/main.c  main (argc, argv) {

FILES
-----

`GTAGS'
     Tag file for object definitions.

`GRTAGS'

`$HOME/.globalrc', `/etc/gtags.conf', `[sysconfdir]/gtags.conf'
     Configuration file.

`gtags.files'
     The list of candidates of target files.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

The following environment variables affect the execution of gtags:
TMPDIR
     The location used to stored temporary files. The default is `/tmp'.

GTAGSCONF
     Configuration file. The default is `$HOME/.globalrc'.

GTAGSLABEL
     Configuration label. The default is default.

GTAGSCACHE
     The size of B-tree cache. The default is 50000000 (bytes).

GTAGSFORCECPP
     If this variable is set, each file whose suffix is 'h' is treated
     as a C++ source file.

MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX
     If this variable is set, `$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX' is used as the prefix
     of BSD-style objdir. The default is `/usr/obj'.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The following configuration variables affect the execution of gtags.
You can see the default value for each variable with the `--config'
option.
`icase_path'(boolean)
     Ignore case distinctions in the path.  Suffixes check are affected
     by this capability.

`langmap'(comma separated list)
     Language mapping. Each comma-separated map consists of the
     language name, a colon, and a list of file extensions.  As a
     special exception, gtags collect values from multiple `langmap'
     variables.  Default mapping is
     'c:.c.h,yacc:.y,asm:.s.S,java:.java,cpp:.c++.cc.cpp.cxx.hxx.hpp.C.H,php:.php.php3.phtml'.

`gtags_parser'(comma separated list)
     Specify the mapping of funtion layer plugin parser.  Each part
     delimited by the comma consists of the language name, a colon, the
     shared object path, an optional colon followed by a function name.
     If the function name is not specified, 'parser' is assumed.  As a
     special exception, gtags collect values from multiple
     `gtags_parser' variables.

`skip'(comma separated list)
     Gtags skips files which are listed in this list.  As a special
     exception, gtags collect values from multiple `skip' variables.
     If the value ends with '/', it assumed as a directory and gtags
     skips all files under it.  If the value start with '/', it assumed
     relative path from the root of source directory.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

Gtags exits with a non 0 value if an error occurred, 0 otherwise.

SEE ALSO
--------

global(1), htags(1).

   GNU GLOBAL source code tag system
(http://www.gnu.org/software/global/).

BUG
---

`GTAGS' and `GRTAGS' are very large.  In advance of using this command,
check the space of your disk.

   Assembly support is far from complete.  It extracts only ENTRY() and
ALTENTRY() from source file.  Probably valid only for FreeBSD and Linux
kernel source.

   There is no concurrency control about tag files.

5.3 htags - generate a hypertext from a set of source files.
============================================================

NAME
----

htags - generate a hypertext from a set of source files.

SYNOPSIS
--------



     htags [-acDfFghInosTvwx][-d dbpath][-m name][-t title][dir]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Htags generates a hypertext from a set of source files of C, C++, Yacc,
Java, PHP and Assembly.

   In advance of using this command, you should execute gtags(1) in the
root directory of a source project.  Then you can execute htags in the
same place.  Htags makes a directory named `HTML', and put a hypertext
in it.  You can start browsing at `HTML/index.html'.

   Since htags generates a static hypertext as long as the `-D' or `-f'
option is not specified, you can move it anywhere and browse it by any
browser without any HTTP server.

   This command has so many options.  If you are new on htags, it is
recommended to use the `--suggest' option.  With that option, htags
chooses popular options on behalf of you.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options are available:
`-a', `--alphabet'
     Make an alphabetical object index which is suitable for large
     projects.

`--auto-completion'[=limit]
     Enable auto completion facility for the input form.  If limit is
     specified, the number of candidates is limited to the value.
     Please note that this function requires javascript language in
     your browser.

`--caution'
     Display a caution message on the top page.

`--cflow' cflowfile
     Add a call tree by cflow(1). cflowfile must be posix format.  If
     you use GNU cflow, invoke the command at the root directory of the
     project with the `--format=posix' option. See EXAMPLES.

`-c', `--compact'
     Compress html files by gzip(1).  You need to configure HTTP server
     so that gzip(1) is invoked for each compressed file.  See
     `HTML/.htaccess' that is generated by htags.

`--cvsweb' url
     Add a link to cvsweb. url is used as the base of URL.  When
     directory `CVS' exists in the root directory of the source project,
     the content of `CVS/Repository' is used as the relative path from
     the base.

`--cvsweb-cvsroot' cvsroot
     Specify cvsroot in cvsweb URL.

`-D', `--dynamic'
     Generate object lists dynamically using CGI program.  Though this
     option decrease both the size and generation time of hypertext,
     you need to start up HTTP server.

`-d', `--dbpath' dbpath
     Specify a directory in which `GTAGS' exist.  The default is the
     current directory.

`--disable-grep'
     Disable grep in the search form(-f,-form).

`-f', `--form'
     Add a search form using CGI program.  You need to start up HTTP
     server for it.

`--full-path'
     Use full path name in the file index.  By default, use just the
     last component of a path.

`-g', `--gtags'

     are passed to gtags.

`--gtagsconf' file
     Set the GTAGSCONF environment variable to file.

`--gtagslabel' label
     Set the GTAGSLABEL environment variable to label.

`-h', `--func-header'[=position]
     Insert function header for each function.  By default, htags
     doesn't generate it.  You can specify the position using position
     argument, which allows one of before, right and after.  The
     default position is after.

`--html'
     Generate HTML hypertext instead of XHTML.

`--html-header' file
     Insert header records derived from file into the HTML header.

`-I', `--icon'
     Use icons instead of text for some links.

     generates them.

`-o', `--other'
     Pick up not only source files but also other files in the file
     index.

`--overwrite-key'
     Allow the same key as the parameter of the `--system-cgi' option.

`--system-cgi' key
     Use the system CGI script. The key must be a unique key in your
     site.  At the first time, you should (1) copy the CGI script
     written by this command into the system CGI directory, and (2)
     execute bless.sh script at the HTML directory as a root user.

`-s', `--symbol'
     Make anchors not only for object definitions and references but
     also other symbols.

`--show-position'
     Show position per function definition. The default is false.

5.4 gozilla - force mozilla to display specified part of a source file.
=======================================================================

NAME
----

gozilla - force mozilla to display specified part of a source file.

SYNOPSIS
--------



     gozilla [-b browser][-p][+no] file
     gozilla [-b browser][-p] -d name

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Gozilla forces mozilla to display specified part of a source file.
Gozilla can be used with other browsers like firefox and epiphany.

   In advance of using this command, you must execute gtags(1) and
htags(1) at the root directory of a project to make tag files.  Then
you can execute this command anywhere in the project.

   First form:
You can specify a source file and optional line number.  This syntax is
similar to vi(1) and emacs(1).

   Second form:
You can specify a definition name directly. The definition name should
exist in `GTAGS'.

   Some browsers require you to load it before executing gozilla.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options are available:
`+no'
     Line number.

`-b' browser
     Browser to use. By default, it is assumed mozilla.

`-d' name
     Print object definitions.

`--help'
     Show help.

`-p'
     Print just a generated URL instead of displaying it.

file
     File name or alias name.

`-q', `--quiet'
     Quiet mode.

`-v', `--verbose'
     Verbose mode.

`--version'
     Show version number.

FILES
-----

`HTML/'
     Hypertext of source code.

`GTAGS/'
     Tag file for object definitions.

`$HOME/.gozillarc'
     Alias file. Please read source code for the detail.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

GTAGSROOT
     The root directory of the project.

GTAGSDBPATH
     The directory on which tag files exist.  This value is ignored
     when GTAGSROOT is not defined.

BROWSER
     Browser to use. By default, it is assumed mozilla.

EXAMPLES
--------

     	$ gtags
     	$ htags
     	$ global -x main
     	main              82 ctags.c          main(argc, argv)
     	$ mozilla &
     	$ gozilla +82 ctags.c
     	$ gozilla -d main

     	$ firefox &
     	$ gozilla -b firefox +82 ctags.c

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

Gozilla exits with a non 0 value if an error occurred, 0 otherwise.

NOTES
-----

Gozilla means 'Global for mozilla'.

BUGS
----

Gozilla can accept not only source files but also text files,
directories, HTML files and even URLs, because it is omnivorous.

5.5 gtags-cscope - pseudo cscope which implements the line-oriented interface
=============================================================================

NAME
----

gtags-cscope - pseudo cscope which implements the line-oriented
interface

SYNOPSIS
--------



     gtags-cscope [-Cqv]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Gtags-cscope is a pseudo cscope which implements the line-oriented
interface of cscope(1).  You can use this command for various clients
instead of true cscope.

   Since gtags-cscope is intended to make GLOBAL available through
cscope interface, the output is not necessarily the same as cscope.

   Command 2 is not available.  This command is used as a internal
command for context search.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options are available:
`-C', `--ignore-case'
     Ignore letter case when searching.

`-q', `--quiet'
     Quiet mode.

`-v', `--verbose'
     Verbose mode.

EXAMPLES
--------

     	$ gtags-cscope
     	>> help
     	0<arg>: Find this C symbol

File: global.info,  Node: GNU Free Documentation License,  Up: Copying This Manual

A.1 GNU Free Documentation License
==================================

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

A.1.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

B.1 The BOKIN Model Definition
==============================

     Version 1.0, December 17, 2005
     Copyright (C) 2005 Tama Communications Corporation

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this document, but changing it is not allowed.

Introduction
------------

"BOKIN Model" is a business model to obtain proceeds by widely
collecting donations while developing and distributing free software.
This model is constructed not to take away consumer's freedom of
software.

   The business which comply with the following criteria can be called
"a business based on BOKIN Model".

Criteria
--------

  1. CORPORATION
     The person who start a business based on BOKIN Model must be a
     business corporation registered in the home country.  (Herein
     after called "the corporation")

  2. FREE SOFTWARE
     The corporation develops free software. (Herein after called "the
     BOKINware")

  3. LICENSE
     The corporation distributes the BOKINware under GNU GPL (GNU
     General Public License) and GNU FDL (GNU Free Documentation
     License). Exceptionally, external packages which the BOKINware
     uses, small supporting files, short manuals and rough
     documentation can use simple all-permissive license, compatible
     with GNU GPL.

  4. COPYRIGHT MANAGEMENT
     The corporation manages copyright on the BOKINware for consumers to
     keep on using it at ease.

        * Every file in the BOKINware should have a legally valid
          copyright notice and a license notice.

        * To include program which is assigned from another developer,
          the corporation receives a disclaimer paper or assignment
          paper signed by the author.

        * To include program which is not assigned, the corporation
          confirms its license is GNU GPL or compatible with GNU GPL,
          lists the files and authors in a file named `AUTHORS', and
          lists the license in a file named `LICENSE'.  The BOKINware
          should contain these two files.

  5. MAILING LIST
     The corporation maintains mailing lists for consumers to cooperate
     one another.

     The list members, including the corporation, don't owe any duty.

     The mailing lists should include the following two at least.

        * Bug mailing list
          This list distributes, to the active maintainers of the
          BOKINware, bug reports and fixes for, and suggestions for
          improvements in the BOKINware. This list is also for user
          discussion.

        * Help mailing list
          This list is the place for authors, users and installers of
          the BOKINware to ask for help.

     The mailing lists can be replaced with a similar communication
     tool.

     The corporation can decide the operation policy of the list, but
     must not obstruct the list members to cooperate one another.

  6. COLLECTING DONATIONS
     The corporation collects donations widely as its proceeds.

     The corporation must not offer the donor an individual supply of
     profit.

  7. DONOR LIST
     The corporation open the donor list to the public.

     The donor list includes the following information.

        * Date of donation (The date when the corporation received the
          donation)

        * Amount of donation (Amount which the corporation received)

        * Donor's name

        * Donor's nationality

     When donor's name and nationality are unknown or the donor prefers
     to remain anonymous, they are treated as "anonymous".

     The BOKINware should contain the donor list as a file named
     `DONORS'.  It is preferable that the list is open to the public
     even on the Internet.

  8. BOKIN MODEL DEFINITION
     The BOKINware should contain the present definition as a file named
     `BOKIN_MODEL'.


Renewal
-------

The author may publish revised and/or new versions of the BOKIN Model
Definition from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.

B.2 Frequently Asked Questions
==============================

     Version 1.0, December 17, 2005
     Copyright (C) 2005 Tama Communications Corporation

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this document, but changing it is not allowed.

BOKIN Model Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------------------

  1. What does "BOKIN" mean?
     "BOKIN" means collecting donations in Japanese.  ("BO"=collect,
     "KIN"=money)

  2. What is the purpose to require the person who start a BOKIN model
     business being a registered corporation?
     The purpose is to prevent people from donating to the person who
     does not exist actually.

  3. Is annoying copyright management necessary?
     Yes, it is.  Copyright management is absolutely necessary for
     consumers to keep on using the BOKINware at ease.

     It is dangerous to use the software whose copyright is not neatly
     managed.  If you use such software, you might suddenly be
     prohibited to use it, or be claimed a license fee of high priced.
     These are not imaginary fears but troubles of reality.

  4. Why is program license limited to GNU GPL?
     Because GNU GPL defends consumers in two points.
        * Copyleft License
          Since GNU GPL is copyleft license, it makes a program free,
          and requiring all modified and extended versions of the
          program to be free as well. As a result, consumer can keep on
          using the BOKINware at ease in the future.

        * Widely Known
          Since GNU GPL is widely known, and is explained frequently,
          it does not become the load to consumer. It is troublesome
          for consumer to understand new licenses.

  5. What is the purpose of the donor list?
     There are two purposes.
        * To defend freedom of donation.
          The consumer can decide whether to donate after understanding
          the situation of the donation.  If nothing being informed,
          freedom does not exist there.  In BOKIN model, consumers are
          not isolated existence.

        * To praise donation.
          To praise donation brings new donors.  Since BOKIN model owes
          all to people's free wills, we cannot praise the donation too
          much.

  6. Is donation spent on the BOKINware?
     It depends on the management of the corporation.  Since donations
     become the proceeds of the corporation, the corporation itself
     decides the usage under its freedom.

  7. Is the donor list kept true?
     It is very difficult to mix lies in the public information, because
     it is checked by various methods.

        * Donors can confirm whether they are listed.

        * People can ask whether to have donated to the donors in the
          list.

        * The tax office can examine the contradiction between the
          content of the list and the content of the declaration of the
          corporation's taxation business.

  8. Why is the corporation prohibited from doing an individual supply
     of profit for the donors?
     When individual supply of profit becomes ordinary, donation fall
     into the payment for the profit. We cannot call it donation.
     BOKIN Model business should be supported only by people's free
     will.
