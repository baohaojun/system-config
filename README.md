ngit is an ncurses based UI to quickly select a git commit from a 'git log
--online' output and press a key on it to perform a single action (Checkout,
reword changelog, edit patch, etc). Opens up vim editor when needed. Inspired
by a grep frontend called ngp.

It is written purely in bash and python.

Run ngit in any git repository. Type 'h' for usage instructions.

Note that the advanced tgit project can do much more than ngit, however this is
more suitable for using with the fewest key strokes IMHO.
