1 Introduction
**************

Emms is the Emacs Multi-Media System.  It tries to be a clean and small
application to play multimedia files from Emacs using external players.
Many of its ideas are derived from MpthreePlayer
(http://www.nongnu.org/mp3player), but it tries to be more general and
more clean.

   This manual tries to be the definitive source of information about
Emms, an online version of the manual is available at:
<http://www.gnu.org/software/emms/manual/>.

   The basic functionality of Emms consists of three parts: The core,
the sources, and the players.

   The core resides in 'emms.el', and provides a simple playlist and the
basic functionality to use all the other features of Emms.  It provides
the common user commands and interfaces for other parts.  It thinks in
tracks, where a track is the combination of a type and a name - e.g.
the track type 'file has a name that is the file name.  Other track
types are possible.

   To get to tracks, the core needs sources.  The file
'emms-source-file.el' provides simple sources to interact with the file
system.

   When Emms finally has the sources in the playlist, it needs a player
to play them.  'emms-player-simple.el' defines a few useful players, and
allows you to define your own in a very simple way.

   The Emms core comes with many additional features to extend its
functionality.

   The way Emms works is easy to customize with your own code or by
using 'M-x customize' or by changing the variables directly.

2 Quickstart Guide
******************

This chapter demonstrates how to setup Emms so that you can start
listening to your music without having to read all of the documentation
first.  This is the tl;dr version of the manual.

   The first thing you have to do is telling Emacs where Emms is
located.  Let's say you have it in '~/elisp/emms/'.  So add this line to
your '.emacs':

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/emms/lisp/")

   More detailed information about installing Emms can be found in the
installation chapter, *Note Installation::.

   You'll then want to load Emms into Emacs.  To achieve this you invoke
the 'emms-all' setup function by adding the following three lines to
your '.emacs'.

     (require 'emms-setup)
     (emms-all)
     (emms-default-players)

   The function 'emms-default-players' in the last line sets up the list
of default players.  The list contains lightweight specialized players
like ogg123 or mpg321 and we-play-everything-players such as mplayer,
mpv, vlc, etc..  To be sure that emms can play all your music you should
check that your preferred players are installed on the machine.

   More detail about setting up Emms can be found in the setup chapter,
*Note Setup::.

   Emms tries to display the tags (the name of the song, as opposed to
the name of the file) of the music you listen to.  Emms can use libtag,
see *Note Using TagLib::, or a combination of other software such as
'mp3info', 'ogginfo' and 'opusinfo' (make sure that they are installed
if you want Emms to use them.)

   The last thing to do is to tell Emms where your music is; the root
directory of our music collection.  Let's say all your music is in
'~/Music' or in subdirectories thereof.

     (setq emms-source-file-default-directory "~/Music/")

   OK, now we've set up Emms.  Reload your '.emacs' or restart Emacs to
let the changes have an effect.

   Now we will add all our music to a playlist by invoking 'M-x
emms-add-directory-tree RET ~/Music/ RET'.  We do this because then Emms
will read the tags of all your music files and caches them (this is also
required for the Emms browser, *Note The Browser::.)

   To switch to the playlist buffer, invoke 'M-x emms-playlist-mode-go'
or simply 'M-x emms'.  You may see that some tracks are displayed with
their file name, but as Emms populates its tag cahe, track by track, the
filenames get replaced with the artist and track name of the file's tag.

   Go ahead and navigate to a track and hit 'RET' on it to start
playback.

   Now you can start exploring Emms.  It's probably best to begin with
the basic commands (*note Basic Commands::), the interactive playlists
(*note Interactive Playlists::), and the browser (*note The Browser::).


File: emms.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Setup,  Prev: Quickstart Guide,  Up: Top

3 Installation
**************

You need to put all the .el files of emms in a directory in your
load-path.  For example, if you put all those files into ~/elisp/emms/,
then in your ~/.emacs, you should do:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/emms/lisp/")

* Menu:

* Compiling Emms::      Compiling Emms into Byte-Code.


File: emms.info,  Node: Compiling Emms,  Up: Installation

3.1 Compiling Emms
==================

If you are using XEmacs, you will need to edit 'Makefile' as follows
before continuing.

     EMACS=xemacs
     SITEFLAG=-no-site-file

   You can byte-compile Emms by first entering the directory containing
the Emms source code, followed by invoking:

   'make'

   Which will byte compile Emms.  You can then invoke:

   'make install'

   Which will install Emms into your Emacs directories (provided you
have the appropriate permissions to do so on your system).

   Note that Emms is a light-weight and agile program, you can therefore
run Emms just fine without byte compiling it.


File: emms.info,  Node: Setup,  Next: Configuration,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

4 Setup
*******

The 'emms-setup' feature is provided by the file 'emms-setup.el'.  It is
essentially a collection of shortcuts for loading different Emms
features quickly, but everything you can do with 'emms-setup' can also
be done manually.

   We use 'emms-setup' by calling one of the setup functions.

 -- Function: emms-minimalistic
     An Emms setup script.  Playlists and all the basics for playing
     media, but nothing else.

 -- Function: emms-all
     An Emms setup script.  Loads all the stable features which come
     with the Emms distribution.

   'emms-setup' also comes with a convenience function to set a default
list of media players.

 -- Function: emms-default-players
     Set EMMS-PLAYER-LIST to EMMS-SETUP-DEFAULT-PLAYER-LIST.

   You can of course write your own Emms setup functions like the above
by looking at the existing function definitions in 'emms-setup.el'.


File: emms.info,  Node: Configuration,  Next: Getting Help,  Prev: Setup,  Up: Top

5 Configuration
***************

This chapter discusses the configuration of Emms in more detail.

   The following code fragment provides a minimal Emms setup without
using the layer of 'emms-setup'.  It can maybe be used to better
understand the internals of Emms.  You can see how Emms needs to know
about players (these are defined in 'emms-player-simple') and about
sources for tracks (trivial file system based sources, such as this
'emms-directory-tree', are defined in 'emms-source-file').

     (require 'emms-player-simple)
     (require 'emms-source-file)
     (require 'emms-source-playlist)
     (setq emms-player-list '(emms-player-mpg321
                              emms-player-ogg123
                              emms-player-mplayer))

   For a discussion on how to define additional players, see *Note
Simple Players::.

   Much of the behaviour of Emms can be changed by setting variables.
For example:

     (setq emms-info-asynchronously nil)
     (setq emms-playlist-buffer-name "*Music*")

   The first 'setq' turns off the asynchronous updating of info tags.
The second sets the default name of the Emms playlist buffer.

   Another way to change Emms variables is to use the M-x 'customize'
mechanism provided by Emacs.

* Menu:

* Finding files and speed::     Finding files quickly or portably.


File: emms.info,  Node: Finding files and speed,  Up: Configuration

5.1 Finding files and speed
===========================

Emms needs to traverse directories in order to find playable media.  The
default method Emms uses to achive this is
'emms-source-file-directory-tree-internal' as defined in
'emms-source-file.el'.  The above method is written portably and will
always work, but might be too slow if we want to load several hundred
tracks (or more).

   'emms-source-file.el' defines another method for finding files,
'emms-source-file-directory-tree-find' which uses GNU/find.
'emms-source-file-directory-tree-find' is usually an order of magnitude
faster, but of course will not work if you do not have GNU/find
installed.

   The method Emms will use is defined in the customisable variable
EMMS-SOURCE-FILE-DIRECTORY-TREE-FUNCTION.

6 Getting Help
**************

If you have a bug to report, need help, or wish to suggest a feature,
please feel free to use the Emms mailing list.  The address of the list
is emms-help@gnu.org.  To subscribe to it, visit
<http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emms-help>.

   If you are familiar with the Gmane service, there is a Gmane
newsgroup which mirrors this mailing address at gmane.emacs.emms.user.

   Emms also has a website at <http://www.gnu.org/software/emms/>.


File: emms.info,  Node: Formats and Freedom,  Next: Basic Commands,  Prev: Getting Help,  Up: Top

7 Formats and Freedom
*********************

Emms is free software, but some of the file formats it can play carry
restrictions, they are proprietary file formats.  Proprietary software
companies are pushing out audio and video formats which restrict when,
where and how you can play them, and restrict developers from writing
free software which interacts with them.

   Restrictive file formats put the corporate bottom-line before the
public interest.

   Fortunately there are alternatives like Ogg.  Ogg is a professional
grade multimedia format.  Ogg Vorbis is the compressed audio format
(like MP3), and Ogg Theora is the video format.  For more information,
go to <http://www.xiph.org/>.

   If you want to transcode audio into a lossless format, you can try
FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec).  FLAC stands out as the fastest and
most widely supported lossless audio codec, and the only one that at
once is non-proprietary, is unencumbered by patents and has the source
code for a reference implementation freely available.  For more
information about FLAC, go to <http://flac.sourceforge.net/>.


File: emms.info,  Node: Basic Commands,  Next: The Core File,  Prev: Formats and Freedom,  Up: Top

8 Basic Commands
****************

Before you can use the interface commands, you need a playlist to start
with.  The following commands allow you to add to the current playlist
from different sources:

   Note that the commands with the "emms-add-" prefix add the source to
the playlist but do not start playing it immediately.  Conversely, the
commands with the "emms-play-" prefix begin playing the track
immediately.

 -- Function: emms-play-file file
     A source for a single file - either FILE, or queried from the user.
     If called with a prefix the file will be added like
     'emms-add-file'.
 -- Function: emms-add-file file
     A source for a single file - either FILE, or queried from the user.
     If called with a prefix the file will be played like
     'emms-play-file'.
 -- Function: emms-play-directory dir
     A source for a whole directory tree - either DIR, or queried from
     the user.
 -- Function: emms-add-directory dir
     A source for a whole directory tree - either DIR, or queried from
     the user.
 -- Function: emms-play-directory-tree dir
     A source for multiple directory trees - either DIR, or the value of
     EMMS-SOURCE-FILE-DEFAULT-DIRECTORY.
 -- Function: emms-add-directory-tree dir
     A source for multiple directory trees - either DIR, or the value of
     EMMS-SOURCE-FILE-DEFAULT-DIRECTORY.
 -- Function: emms-play-url url
     A source for an URL - for example, for streaming.
 -- Function: emms-add-url url
     A source for an URL - for example, for streaming.
 -- Function: emms-play-playlist playlist
     A source for the M3u or PLS playlist format from the file PLAYLIST.
 -- Function: emms-add-playlist playlist
     A source for the M3u or PLS playlist format from the file PLAYLIST.
 -- Function: emms-play-find dir regexp
     A source that will find files in DIR or
     EMMS-SOURCE-FILE-DEFAULT-DIRECTORY which match REGEXP.
 -- Function: emms-add-find dir regexp
     A source that will find files in DIR or
     EMMS-SOURCE-FILE-DEFAULT-DIRECTORY which match REGEXP.

   The basic functionality of Emms is just to play music without being
noticed.  It provides a few commands to skip the current track and such,
but other than that it doesn't show up.  Emms provides the following
basic user commands (which you might want to bind to keystrokes):

 -- Function: emms-start
     Start playing the current playlist
 -- Function: emms-stop
     Stop playing
 -- Function: emms-next
     Start playing the next track in the playlist
 -- Function: emms-previous
     Start playing previous track in the playlist
 -- Function: emms-shuffle
     Shuffle the current playlist.  This uses
     EMMS-PLAYLIST-SHUFFLE-FUNCTION.
 -- Function: emms-sort
     Sort the current playlist.  This uses EMMS-PLAYLIST-SORT-FUNCTION.
 -- Function: emms-show &optional insertp
     Describe the current Emms track in the minibuffer.  If INSERTP is
     non-nil, insert the description into the current buffer instead.
     This function uses EMMS-SHOW-FORMAT to format the current track.

   The command 'emms-show-all' will pop up a window with the complete
information about the track being played.  'emms-show-all' is provided
by 'emms-show-all.el', which is included in the 'emms-all' setup level.
See *Note Setup::.

9 The Core File
***************

The core file 'emms.el' provides the all basic functions for playing
music, generating playlists and defining players.

* Menu:

* User Variables::     Variables for the user to tweak.
* Hooks::              Hooks for important Emms functions.
* Core Functions::     Providing the basic functionality of Emms.


File: emms.info,  Node: User Variables,  Next: Hooks,  Up: The Core File

9.1 User Variables
==================

The core file defines a number of user variables.

 -- User Option: emms-player-list
     A list of players Emms can use.  You need to set this in order to
     use Emms to play media.
 -- User Option: emms-show-format
     The format to use for 'emms-show'.  Any "%s" is replaced by what
     EMMS-TRACK-DESCRIPTION-FUNCTION returns for the currently playing
     track.
 -- User Option: emms-repeat-playlist
     Non-nil if the Emms playlist should automatically repeat the
     playlist.  If nil, playback will stop when the last track finishes
     playing.
 -- User Option: emms-track-description-function
     Function for describing an Emms track in a user-friendly way.
 -- User Option: emms-sort-lessp-function
     A function that compares two tracks, and returns non-nil if the
     first track should be sorted before the second (see also 'sort').


File: emms.info,  Node: Hooks,  Next: Core Functions,  Prev: User Variables,  Up: The Core File

9.2 Hooks
=========

The core file provides hook variables for the basic functionality of
Emms.

 -- User Option: emms-player-started-hook
     A hook run when an Emms player started playing.
 -- User Option: emms-player-stopped-hook
     A hook run when an Emms player stopped playing.  See also
     EMMS-PLAYER-FINISHED-HOOK.
 -- User Option: emms-playlist-source-inserted-hook
     Hook run when a source got inserted into the playlist.  The buffer
     is narrowed to the new tracks.
 -- User Option: emms-playlist-selection-changed-hook
     Hook run after another track is selected in the Emms playlist.
 -- User Option: emms-playlist-cleared-hook
     Hook run after the current Emms playlist is cleared.  This happens
     both when the playlist is cleared and when a new buffer is created
     for it.
 -- User Option: emms-player-finished-hook
     Hook run when an Emms player finishes playing a track.  Please pay
     attention to the differences between EMMS-PLAYER-FINISHED-HOOK and
     EMMS-PLAYER-STOPPED-HOOK.  The former is called only when the
     player is stopped interactively; the latter, only when the player
     actually finishes playing a track.
 -- User Option: emms-player-paused-hook
     Hook run when a player is paused or resumed.  Use
     EMMS-PLAYER-PAUSED-P to find the current state.


File: emms.info,  Node: Core Functions,  Prev: Hooks,  Up: The Core File

9.3 Core Functions
==================

The core file also defines all the functions important to the basic use
of Emms.

   There are functions which deal with movement in the playlist.

 -- Function: emms-next-noerror
     Start playing the next track in the Emms playlist.  Unlike
     'emms-next', this function doesn't signal an error when called at
     the end of the playlist.  This function should only be called when
     no player is playing.  This is a good function to put in
     'emms-player-finished-hook'.
 -- Function: emms-playlist-next
     Move to the previous track in the current buffer.
 -- Function: emms-playlist-previous
     Move to the previous track in the current buffer.
 -- Function: emms-random
     Jump to a random track.
 -- Function: emms-toggle-repeat-playlist
     Toggle whether emms repeats the playlist after it is done.  See
     EMMS-REPEAT-PLAYLIST.
 -- Function: emms-toggle-repeat-track
     Toggle whether emms repeats the current track.  See
     EMMS-REPEAT-TRACK.
 -- Function: emms-toggle-random-playlist
     Toggle whether emms plays the tracks randomly or sequentially.  See
   EMMS-RANDOM-PLAYLIST.

   Some functions deal with the getting and setting track information.

 -- Function: emms-track type name
     Create a track with type TYPE and name NAME.
 -- Function: emms-track-type track
     Return the type of TRACK.
 -- Function: emms-track-name track
     Return the name of TRACK.
 -- Function: emms-track-get name track &optional inexistent
     Return the value of NAME for TRACK.  If there is no value, return
     DEFAULT (or nil, if not given).
 -- Function: emms-track-set track name value
     Set the value of NAME for TRACK to VALUE.
 -- Function: emms-track-description track
     Return a description of TRACK.  This function uses
     EMMS-TRACK-DESCRIPTION-FUNCTION.
 -- Function: emms-player-for track
     Return an Emms player capable of playing TRACK.  This will be the
     first player whose PLAYABLEP function returns non-nil, or nil if no
     such player exists.
 -- Function: emms-playlist-current-selected-track
     Return the currently selected track in the current playlist.

   There are also functions which deal with the playing itself.

 -- Function: emms-player-start track
     Start playing TRACK.
 -- Function: emms-player-stop
     Stop the currently playing player.
 -- Function: emms-player-stopped
     Declare that the current Emms player is finished.  This should only
     be done by the current player itself.
 -- Function: emms-seek seconds
     Seek the current player SECONDS seconds.  This can be a floating
     point number for sub-second fractions.  It can also be negative to
     seek backwards.
 -- Function: emms-seek-forward
     Seek ten seconds forward.
 -- Function: emms-seek-backward
     Seek ten seconds backward.

11 Simple Players
*****************

 -- Macro: define-emms-simple-player name types regex command &rest args
     Define a simple player with the use of 'emms-define-player'.  NAME
     is used to construct the name of the function like
     emms-player-NAME.  TYPES is a list of track types understood by
     this player.  REGEX must be a regexp that matches the filenames the
     player can play.  COMMAND specifies the command line argument to
     call the player and ARGS are the command line arguments.

   For a discussion on how to define new players see *Note New Player::.

 -- Function: emms-player-simple-stop
     Stop the currently playing process, if indeed there is one.
 -- Function: emms-player-simple-start filename cmdname params
     Starts a process playing FILENAME using the specified CMDNAME with
     the specified PARAMS.
 -- Function: emms-player-simple-sentinel proc str
     Sentinel for determining the end of process for the process PROC
     and the sentinel string STR.

12 Playlists
************

Emms uses Emacs buffers to store the media tracks for playing.  We call
one such buffer a "playlist buffer" or an "Emms playlist buffer".  Emms
then proceeds to play the media tracks in the buffer from top to bottom
until the end of the playlist.

   The name of the playlist buffer is defined in the variable
EMMS-PLAYLIST-BUFFER-NAME and is set to be an invisible Emacs buffer by
default.  You can change to any name you want.  For an example
configuration see *Note Configuration::.

   You can create any number of playlist buffers you wish.  At any time
Emms has a single "current" buffer through which it proceeds track by
track.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-new &optional name
     Create a new playlist buffer.  The buffer is named NAME, but made
     unique.  NAME defaults to 'emms-playlist-buffer-name'.  If called
     interactively, the new buffer is also selected.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-save &optional format file
     Store the current playlist to FILE as the type FORMAT. The default
     format is specified by EMMS-SOURCE-PLAYLIST-DEFAULT-FORMAT.

   The current Emms playlist buffer is stored in the variable
EMMS-PLAYLIST-BUFFER.

13 Track Information
********************

Emms is distributed with multiple predefined methods for retrieving
info, provided by modules such as 'emms-info-mp3info.el',
'emms-info-ogginfo.el', 'emms-info-opusinfo.el', 'emms-cue.el' and
'emms-info-libtag.el'.  The first three packages are front-ends for
command-line tools.  Ogg track information is retrieved using the
ogginfo (http://directory.fsf.org/audio/ogg/vorbistools.html) and the
<https://www.opus-codec.org/ opusinfo> software.  Likewise, mp3 track
information is available using mp3info
(http://www.ibiblio.org/mp3info/).  'emms-cue.el' retrieves tracks
information for ape/flac files by parsing a cue sheet file, which is
plain text.  Finally, 'emms-info-libtag.el' uses a tiny C shim (included
in the src/ directory) program to take advantage of TagLib
(http://taglib.github.io/).

   Automatic track information retrieval is enabled by default in the
'emms-all' setup level provided by 'emms-setup.el'.  For more
information about 'emms-setup.el' see *Note Setup::.

   If you would like to know how Emms track retreival works and how we
can define new methods for track retrieval see *Note Defining Info
Methods::.

   There are a number of user variables which control the behaviour of
'emms-info'.

 -- User Option: emms-info-auto-update
     Non-nil when Emms should update track information if the file
     changes.  This will cause hard drive activity on track loading.  If
     this is too annoying for you, set this variable to nil.
 -- User Option: emms-info-asynchronously
     Non-nil when track information should be loaded asynchronously.
     This requires the feature 'later-do' which is provided by the file
     'later-do.el', which comes with Emms.  See LATER-DO-BATCH for
     performance tweaking.
 -- User Option: emms-info-functions
     Functions which add information to tracks.  Each is called with a
     track as argument.

File: emms.info,  Node: Using TagLib,  Next: Defining Info Methods,  Up: Track Information

13.1 Using TagLib
=================

The communication with the TagLib library is done via a tiny program
written in C++ 'emms-print-metadata.cpp'.  To compile
'emms-print-metadata' invoke:

   'make emms-print-metadata'

   The resultant binary will be installed when you invoke:

   'make install' as in *Note Compiling Emms::.

   It is of course also possible to install only the
'emms-print-metadata' binary where your system can find and execute it
without installing all of Emms via the make command.

   Once the binary is available load 'emms-info-libtag' and make it the
_only_ info function with (note that if you have caching enabled you may
have to delete the existing cache and repopulate it in order to see the
TagLib data):

     (require 'emms-info-libtag)
     (setq emms-info-functions '(emms-info-libtag))


File: emms.info,  Node: Defining Info Methods,  Prev: Using TagLib,  Up: Track Information

13.2 Defining Info Methods
==========================

An info method essentially consists of a function which given an Emms
track returns the appropriate info for that track.

   We can for example look at the predefined method for retrieving
information about audio tracks in the Ogg format.

   The function 'emms-info-ogginfo' provided by 'emms-info-ogginfo.el'
accepts an Emms track as a single argument and returns the appropriate
information string.

   We then register our info function with Emms by adding it to the
EMMS-INFO-FUNCTIONS list.  The function will then be called at the right
time to provide track info.

     (add-to-list 'emms-info-functions 'emms-info-ogginfo)

14 Interactive Playlists
************************

Emms provides a visual, interactive playlist mode as well as the ability
to use playlists without ever looking at then.  This visual, interactive
mode is called the 'emms-playlist-mode' and is defined in
'emms-playlist-mode.el'.

   The interactive playlist mode is enabled by default in the 'emms-all'
setup level.  For more information about Emms setup levels see *Note
Setup::.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-mode-go
     Switch to the current emms-playlist buffer and use
     emms-playlist-mode.

   If you wish to make this the default Emms playlist mode, add the
following to your '.emacs'.

     (setq emms-playlist-default-major-mode 'emms-playlist-mode)

   The interactive playlist buffer shows the tracks in the current Emms
playlist in the order in which they will be played.  The current track
will be highlighted.

   When in the interactive playlist mode we can perform different
actions on the current playlist.

'a'
     Add files in the playlist at point to the current playlist buffer.
     If we are in the current playlist, make a new playlist buffer and
     set it as current.
'b'
     Set the current playlist buffer.
'n'
     Start playing the next track in the playlist.
'p'
     Start playing the previous track in the playlist.
's'
     Stop playing.
'P'
     Pause.
'>'
     Seek ten seconds forward.
'<'
     Seek ten seconds backward.
'f'
     Describe the currently playing track in the minibuffer.
'c'
     Display the current track in the center of the screen.
'RET'
     Start playing the track under point.  Note that this is also
     available with '<mouse-2>'.
'SPC'
     Scroll up a near full page.
'M-<'
     Go to the first track in the playlist.
'M->'
     Go to the last track in the playlist.
'r'
     Go to a randomly selected track in the playlist.
'q'
     Put the interactive playlist buffer at the end of the list of all
     buffers.
'C-x C-s'
     Save the current playlist buffer to a file.  By default, Emms will
     ask you for confirmation before overwriting an existing playlist.
     You can silently overwrite existing playlist by setting
     EMMS-SOURCE-PLAYLIST-ASK-BEFORE-OVERWRITE to nil.
'?'
     Describe the mode.

   We can also edit the playlist using familiar GNU/Emacs commands:

'C-k'
     Remove the track under point from the playlist buffer.  Also
     available using the 'd' key.
'C-y'
     See the command 'yank'
'C-w'
     See the command 'kill-region'
'M-y'
     See the command 'yank-pop'.
'C-j'
     Insert a newline at point.

   We can use the regular GNU/Emacs killing and yanking commands to move
and copy tracks in between playlist buffers.  We can use the same
commands to insert arbitrary text into the playlist buffers together
with the playlist tracks.  Text which is not a track is ignored by the
program and can therefore be used to include titles and annotations
within the playlist.


File: emms.info,  Node: Markable Playlists,  Next: Extending Emms,  Prev: Interactive Playlists,  Up: Top

15 Markable Playlists
*********************

The Markable Playlists provided by the file 'emms-mark.el' are an
alternative to the default interactive playlists, *Note Interactive
Playlists::.  They allow marking tracks with keybindings familiar to
users of dired.

   To enable the Markable Playlists you have to add

     (require 'emms-mark)

   to your '.emacs'.  Then you can activate 'emms-mark-mode' by
executing 'M-x emms-mark-mode' in a playlist buffer.  You can return to
the default interactive playlist mode with 'M-x emms-mark-mode-disable'.

   If you wish to make this the default Emms playlist mode, add the
following to your '.emacs'.

     (setq emms-playlist-default-major-mode 'emms-mark-mode)

'm'
     Marks the current track and sets point one line forward.  If a
     prefix argument ARG is given, it will mark the next ARG tracks and
     set point accordingly.  A negative argument marks backward.
'U'
     Unmarks all tracks in the playlist.
't'
     Toggles mark on the current track.
'u'
     Unmarks same way as 'emms-mark-forward' marks.
'% m'
     Marks all tracks in the playlist matching the given regular
     expression.  A prefix argument means to unmark them instead.

   When tracks are marked you can operate on them:

'D'
     Deletes the marked tracks from the playlist.
'K'
     Deletes the marked tracks from the playlist and places them in the
     kill-ring, so that you can 'yank' in into another playlist.
'W'
     Adds the marked tracks to the kill-ring, so that you can 'yank'
     them into another playlist.

   emms-mark is also intent to provide a way for user to select tracks
for other command to operate on them.  Currently, 'emms-tag-editor.el'
uses the emms-mark to edit the tags of selected tracks.  Two functions
are useful for the elisp programer to handle marked tracks.

 -- Function: emms-mark-do-with-marked-track
     This function take a function to perform on all marked tracks.  A
     optional argument 'move-flag' to tell the function to move forward
     line after calling given function.  If the given function didn't
     change position, the second argument should set to non-nil.

 -- Function: emms-mark-mapcar-marked-track
     This function is very similar to 'emms-mark-do-with-marked-track'
     except it collects result of given function (that's why named with
     'mapcar').

Emms introduces a high abstraction layer for playing music so you can
customise it to your needs.

File: emms.info,  Node: New Player,  Next: Simple Player for `play',  Up: Extending Emms

16.1 New Player
===============

The file 'emms-player-simple.el' defines some easy players to start
with, but it shouldn't be hard to provide a function for your favourite
player.  We will start with an easy example that shows how we can use
the 'play' command under Unix to play our WAV files.


File: emms.info,  Node: Simple Player for `play',  Next: More Complex Player,  Prev: New Player,  Up: Extending Emms

16.2 Simple Player for 'play'
=============================

Play is a very easy command line player for various format.  If you want
your emms to play WAV files just put the following lines in you
'.emacs':

     (require 'emms-player-simple)
     (define-emms-simple-player play '(file) "\\.wav$" "play")

   Huh!  Wasn't that easy?

   The macro function 'define-emms-simple-player' takes a minimum of
three arguments.  The first argument (_play_ in our example) defines the
name of the player.  It's used to name the player functions.  The second
is a regexp, that defines which files to play with our player.
_\\.wav$_ matches any filename ending with a dot and the string wav.
The last argument is the actual command line command we use to play our
files.  You can also add the path but we just assume that the command is
in your path.  All arguments you add to these three are optional.  They
define the command line arguments you want to add to your argument.  If
you want to hear the wav file of your favourite artist in the most
possible volume use the following line:

     (require 'emms-player-simple)

     (define-emms-simple-player play
                                '(file)
                                "\\artist-*.wav$"
                                "play"
                                "--volume=100")

   Please notice that you have to add the arguments as strings!

   The command line tool you use for 'define-emms-simple-player' has to
take one song as argument and stop after playing that particular song.
For any other concept you will need to customise emms a bit more...


File: emms.info,  Node: More Complex Player,  Prev: Simple Player for `play',  Up: Extending Emms

16.3 More Complex Player
========================

The most players you use will be simple players so you don't need to
read this chapter.  But if you are curious how you can use (almost)
every player in emms read further...

   In this chapter we will use mpg321 to construct a player that
actually can pause a track, restart it and show rest time.  We won't
implement all of that, but after that chapter you will know how to
define it.

   The command 'define-emms-simple-player' is just a abstraction layer
for 'define-emms-player', which is a little bit more complicated but
much more powerful!

     (define-emms-player "emms-mpg321-remote"
       :start 'emms-mpg321-remote-start
       :stop 'emms-mpg321-remote-stop
       :playablep 'emms-mpg321-remote-playable-p)

   So, that is almost all!  'define-emms-player' takes a minimum of
three arguments.  The first is the name of the player.  The rest are
methods with functions to call.  Three methods are required: start, stop
and playable.  Start says Emms how to start a track (sic!), stop how to
stop a player and playablep should return non-nil if the player can play
the track.

   So we just need these three functions to get our mpg321-remote:

   First we code the start function.  We will check if there's a open
process and start one otherwise.  Then we send a string to the process
with the filename and set a filter.

     (defun emms-mpg321-remote-start ()
       (unless (get-process ``mpg321-remote'')
         (setq emms-mpg321-remote-process
               (start-process "mpg321-remote-process"
                              "*mpg321*" "mpg321" "-R" "abc"))
       (process-send-string "mpg321-remote-process"
                            (concat "l " (emms-track-name track)))
       (set-process-filter emms-mpg321-remote-process 'emms-mpg321-remote-filter)))

   We need the filter, as mpg321-remote won't quit after playing the
track as the simple player do.  We wait until the process sends the
output "(at-sign)P 0" (the signal of mpg321 that the song ended) to the
filter and call emms-mpg321-remote-stop.

     (defun emms-mpg321-remote-filter (process output)
       (when (string-match "(at-sign)P 0" output)
         (emms-mpg321-remote-stop)))

   'emms-mpg321-remote-stop' won't do anything interesting.  It just
test if there are other files to play and close the process otherwise.

     (defun emms-mpg321-remote-stop ()
       (unless emms-playlist
         (process-send-string "mpg321-remote-process" "Q\n"))

   And to make that a playable example I also added
'emms-mpg321-remote-playablep', which I really just steal from
'emms-player-simple.el'

     (defun emms-mpg321-remote-playablep (track)
            "Return non-nil when we can play this track."
            (and (eq 'file (emms-track-type track))

   Now we have a ready player and we could add commands like
'emms-mpg321-remote-pause' for example.

17 The Browser
**************

The Browser allows you to browse the metadata cache and add tracks to
your playlist.  It includes a powerful interactive mode.

   The Browser is defined in 'emms-browser.el' and is included in the
'emms-all' setup level.  For more information about Emms setup levels
see *Note Setup::.

   You can also manually add the Browser to your Emms setup by loading
it explicitly with:

     (require 'emms-browser)

   To be properly useful, you should do M-x 'emms-add-directory-tree' to
all the files you own at least once so that the cache is fully
populated.

17.1 Browser Interface
======================

The browser interface allows you to display and interact with your
tracks in many different ways.  There are a number of ways to start the
browser.

 -- Function: emms-smart-browse
     Display browser and playlist.  Toggle between selecting browser,
     playlist or hiding both.  Tries to behave sanely if the user has
     manually changed the window configuration.

 -- Function: emms-browse-by-genre
     Display the browser and order the tracks by genre.

 -- Function: emms-browse-by-year
     Display the browser and order the tracks by year.

   Once the Browser is displayed you can use it to managed your track
collection and playlists.  The Browser is interactive and has its own
keybindings.

17.2 Filtering Tracks
=====================

If you want to display a subset of your collection (such as a directory
of 80s music, only avi files, etc.)  then you can extend the Browser by
defining "filters".

   Show everything:

     (emms-browser-make-filter "all" 'ignore)

   Set "all" as the default filter:

     (emms-browser-set-filter (assoc "all" emms-browser-filters))

   Show all files (no streamlists, etc):

     (emms-browser-make-filter
      "all-files" (emms-browser-filter-only-type 'file))

   Show only tracks in one folder:

     (emms-browser-make-filter
      "80s" (emms-browser-filter-only-dir "~/Mp3s/80s"))

   Show all tracks played in the last month:

     (emms-browser-make-filter
      "last-month" (emms-browser-filter-only-recent 30))

   After executing the above commands, you can use M-x
emms-browser-show-all, emms-browser-show-80s, etc to toggle between
different collections.  Alternatively you can use '<' and '>' to cycle
through the available filters.

   The second argument to make-filter is a function which returns t if a
single track should be filtered.  You can write your own filter
functions to check the type of a file, etc.

   Show only tracks not played in the last year:

     (emms-browser-make-filter "not-played"
      (lambda (track)
       (not (funcall (emms-browser-filter-only-recent 365) track))))

   Show all files that are not in the pending directory:

     (emms-browser-make-filter
      "all"
      (lambda (track)
        (or
         (funcall (emms-browser-filter-only-type 'file) track)
         (not (funcall
               (emms-browser-filter-only-dir "~/Media/pending") track)))))


File: emms.info,  Node: Displaying Covers,  Next: Changing Looks,  Prev: Filtering Tracks,  Up: The Browser

17.3 Displaying Covers
======================

The browser will attempt to display cover images if they're available.

   Customize EMMS-BROWSER-COVERS to configure how EMMS should retrieve
the covers.

   By default it looks for images 'cover_small.jpg', 'cover_med.jpg',
etc.  Note that you'll probably want to resize your existing covers to
particular sizes.  Suggested sizes are 100x100 for small, and 200x200
for medium.

   The above behaviour demands manual processing on behalf of the user.
Instead, you might prefer to automate the process by setting
EMMS-BROWSER-COVERS to 'emms-browser-cache-thumbnail': covers matching
'emms-browser-thumbnail-filter' will be automatically resized if
necessary and cached to EMMS-BROWSER-THUMBNAIL-DIRECTORY.  The cache
gets automatically updated upon change in the source folder.

   Customize EMMS-BROWSER-COVERS-FILE-EXTENSIONS to include or exclude
specific extensions.

   'emms-browser-cache-thumbnail' might be everytime a cover is queried,
so to help with performance you can also set EMMS-BROWSER-COVERS to
'emms-browser-cache-thumbnail-async'.  The latter is like the former
except that it caches queries: every subsequent query will be much
faster.  The drawback is that it won't see changes made to covers after
the first query.  To force-refresh the thumbnail cache, you can run
'emms-browser-clear-cache-hash'.

   Also, Emacs by default will jump around a lot when scrolling a buffer
with images.  In order to prevent that, you can set
SCROLL-UP-AGGRESSIVELY and SCROLL-DOWN-AGGRESSIVELY to the number "0.0".

   To show a 'no cover' image for albums which don't have a cover, add
the following code to your .emacs:

     (setq emms-browser-default-covers
       (list "/path/to/cover_small.jpg" nil nil)

   The medium and large images can be set as well.

   You can download an example 'no cover' image
(http://repose.cx/cover_small.jpg).

17.4 Changing Looks
===================

The Browser's look can be customised.  You can change the way the tree
structure looks, the display format and display faces.

Changing Tree Structure
-----------------------

You can change the way the tree is displayed by modifying the function
'emms-browser-next-mapping-type'.

   The following code displays artist->track instead of
artist->album->track when you switch to the 'singles' filter:

     (defadvice emms-browser-next-mapping-type
                                     (after no-album (current-mapping))
       (when (eq ad-return-value 'info-album)
         (setq ad-return-value 'info-title)))

     (defun toggle-album-display ()
       (if (string= emms-browser-current-filter-name "singles")
           (ad-activate 'emms-browser-next-mapping-type)
         (ad-deactivate 'emms-browser-next-mapping-type)))

     (add-hook 'emms-browser-filter-changed-hook 'toggle-album-display)

   Furthermore, you can customize EMMS-BROWSER-GET-TRACK-FIELD-FUNCTION
to choose which the metadata fields used for the different tree nodes
(''info-artist', 'info-year', etc.).  For instance, you can choose
whether to organize the tree by artist, album artist or performer.

Changing Display Format
-----------------------

Format strings govern the way items are displayed in the browser and
playlist.  You can customize these if you wish.

   EMMS-BROWSER-DEFAULT-FORMAT controls the format to use when no other
format has been explicitly defined.  By default, only track and albums
deviate from the default.

   To customise the format of a particular type, find the name of the
field you want to use (eg 'info-artist', 'info-title', etc), and insert
that into emms-browser-<type>-format or
emms-browser-playlist-<type>-format.  For example, if you wanted to
remove track numbers from tracks in both the browser and playlist, you
could do:

     (defvar emms-browser-info-title-format "%i%n")
     (defvar emms-browser-playlist-info-title-format
       emms-browser-info-title-format)

   The format specifiers available include:

     %i indent relative to the current level
     %n the value of the item - eg -info-artist might be "pink floyd"
     %y the album year
     %A the album name
     %a the artist name of the track
     %t the title of the track
     %T the track number
     %cS a small album cover
     %cM a medium album cover
     %cL a big album cover

   Note that if you use track-related items like %t, it will take the
data from the first track.

Changing Display Faces
----------------------

The faces used to display the various fields are also customizable.
They are in the format emms-browser-<type>-face, where type is one of
"year/genre", "artist", "album" or "track".  Note that faces lack the
initial "info-" part.  For example, to change the artist face, type M-x
'customize-face' 'emms-browser-artist-face'.

18 Sorting Playlists
********************

The 'emms-playlist-sort' module, defined in the 'emms-playlist-sort.el'
package provides functions for sorting Emms playlists, as well as
keyboard shortcuts for invoking the functions in the playlist buffer.
Most of the functions will sort in reverse order if the command is
preceded by a prefix.  'emms-playlist-sort' can be loaded by invoking:

     (require 'emms-playlist-sort)

 -- Function: emms-playlist-sort-by-info-artist
     Sort by artist name.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-sort-by-play-count
     Sort by number of times the track has been played.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-sort-by-info-album
     Sort by album name.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-sort-by-last-played
     Sort by time the track was played last.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-sort-by-info-title
     Sort by track title.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-sort-by-file-extension
     Sort by filename extension.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-sort-by-info-performer
     Sort by performer name.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-sort-by-info-year
     Sort by year.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-sort-by-info-note
     Sort by track notes.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-sort-by-info-composer
     Sort by composer.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-sort-by-name
     Sort by track name.

 -- Function: emms-playlist-sort-by-file-mtime
     Sort by file mtime.

19 Persistent Playlists
***********************

The Emms module 'emms-history.el' makes playlists persistent over emacs
sessions.  To make use of this feature put this into your ~/.emacs.

     (require 'emms-history)

   When you kill emacs all playlists will be saved in the file given by
the variable:

 -- User Option: emms-history-file
     The file to save playlists in.  It defaults to
     "~/.emacs.d/emms-history".

   After you started up emacs again, you can restore all saved playlists
with this function.

 -- Function: emms-history-load
     Restore all playlists in 'emms-history-file'.

   If that should be done automatically on each startup, put these lines
into your ~/.emacs.

     (require 'emms-history)
     (emms-history-load)

   Normally 'emms-history' only restores playlists.  If you want it to
start playback afterwards, you can tweak this variable.

 -- User Option: emms-history-start-playing
     If non-nil emms starts playing the current track after
     'emms-history-load' was invoked.  The default value is nil.


File: emms.info,  Node: Editing Tracks,  Next: Emms Mode Line,  Prev: Persistent Playlists,  Up: Top

20 Editing Tracks
*****************

Using 'emms-tag-editor.el', emms can set tag informations of tracks and
write them back to the file with the help of external programs, such as
'mid3v2' and 'vorbiscomment'.

   Use the keybinding 'E' to edit the tags of track under point in the
playlist or all marked tracks (*note Markable Playlists:: for how to
mark tracks).  The track's tag informations are listed in a special
buffer '*Emms-TAGS*' in text format.  Field names are marked in bold
face and are not editable.  Any tag information is placed behind an
equal sign and is changable.  A special field 'name' is the track's file
name.  If any change is made in this field, the track's file will be
renamed to the new name.  When you finished editing the tag infos use
'C-c C-c' (which calls 'emms-tag-editor-submit-and-exit') to submit the
changes and close the '*Emms-TAGS*' buffer.

   There are a few commands to perform changes on all tracks.

 -- Function: emms-tag-editor-set-all tag value
     Set TAG to VALUE in all tracks.

     If transient-mark-mode is turned on, you can apply the command to a
     selected region.

     If 'transient-mark-mode' is on and the mark is active, the changes
     will only take effect on the tracks in the region.

 -- Function: emms-tag-editor-replace-in-tag tag from to
     Query and replace text in selected TAG.

     For example, if the info-title tag is selected, then only perform
     replacement in title tags.

     If 'transient-mark-mode' is on and the mark is active, the changes
     will only take effect on the tracks in the region.

 -- Function: emms-tag-editor-transpose-tag tag1 tag2
     Transpose value of TAG1 and TAG2.

     If 'transient-mark-mode' is on and the mark is active, the changes
     will only take effect on the tracks in the region.

 -- Function: emms-tag-editor-submit arg
     Make modified tags take affect.

     With prefix argument, bury the tag edit buffer.

   If you want to extend the tag editor to work with file formats other
than 'mp3' and 'ogg', have a look at these variables.

 -- Variable: emms-tag-editor-formats
     This variable determine how to insert track fields to
     'emms-tag-editor-edit-buffer'.  Emms tag info editable fields is
     usually determined by the extension of track name.  The variable
     'emms-tag-editor-tags' contains all tags that emms track may have.
     A single charactar is assigned to the tag to make the
     'emms-tag-editor-formats' easier to generate.

 -- Variable: emms-tag-editor-tagfile-functions
     To write tags to track file, an extern program should specified in
     this variable.

Renaming Files
==============

The tag editor is also capable to rename the file of the track at point
or all files of the marked tracks according to the value this variable.

 -- User Option: emms-tag-editor-rename-format
     When 'emms-tag-editor-rename' is invoked the track's file will be
     renamed according this format specification.  The file extension
     will be added automatically.

     It uses the format specs defined in 'emms-tag-editor-tags'.

     The default value is "%a - %l - %n - %t", so that files are named

     <Artist> - <Album> - <Tracknumber> - <Title>.<extension>

     after renaming.

   To perform the renaming put point on the track you want to rename or
mark some tracks.  Then hit 'R' which calls this function:

 -- Function: emms-tag-editor-rename
     Rename the file corresponding to track at point or all marked
     tracks according to the value of 'emms-tag-editor-rename-format'.

21 Emms Mode Line
*****************

We can display information about the currenty playing track on the Emacs
mode line using the package 'emms-mode-line' which is provided by the
file 'emms-mode-line.el'.

   To activate this feature invoke:

     (require 'emms-mode-line)
     (emms-mode-line 1)

   It is also possible to display the amount of time a track has been
playing.  This feature is defined in the 'emms-playing-time' package
which is provided by the file 'emms-playing-time.el'.

   To use this feature invoke:

     (require 'emms-playing-time)
     (emms-playing-time 1)

   Note: '(emms-playing-time -1)' will disable emms-playing-time module
completely, and is not recommended.  (since some other emms modules may
rely on it)

   Instead, to toggle displaying playing time on mode line, one could
call 'emms-playing-time-enable-display' and
'emms-playing-time-disable-display'."

 -- Function: emms-playing-time-enable-display
     Display playing time on mode line.

 -- Function: emms-playing-time-disable-display
     Remove playing time from mode line.

22 Limiting
***********

The package 'emms-playlist-limit', provided by 'emms-playlist-limit.el',
allows creating a new playlist derived from the playlist in the current
buffer.  For instance, it is possible to create a new playlist
containing only a certain artist or genre from the playlist in the
current buffer.

   If the playlist in the current buffer is the emms current playlist
then the derived playlist becomes current.

'/ a'
     Create a new playlist buffer and populate it with tracks whose
     artist info field matches the given regular expression (default:
     the artist info field of the track at point).

'/ b'
     Create a new playlist buffer and populate it with tracks whose
     album info field matches the given regular expression (default: the
     album info field of the track at point).

'/ c'
     Create a new playlist buffer and populate it with tracks whose
     composer info field matches the given regular expression (default:
     the composer info field of the track at point).

'/ d'
     Create a new playlist buffer and populate it with tracks whose
     track description matches the given regular expression (default:
     the track description of the track at point).

'/ g'
     Create a new playlist buffer and populate it with tracks whose
     genre info field matches the given regular expression (default: the
     genre info field of the track at point).

'/ n'
     Create a new playlist buffer and populate it with tracks whose name
     matches the given regular expression (default: the name of the
     track at point).

'/ p'
     Create a new playlist buffer and populate it with tracks whose
     performer info field matches the given regular expression (default:
     the performer info field of the track at point).

'/ t'
     Create a new playlist buffer and populate it with tracks whose
     title info field matches the given regular expression (default: the
     title info field of the track at point).

'/ y'
     Create a new playlist buffer and populate it with tracks whose year
     info field matches the given regular expression (default: the year
     info field of the track at point).

'/ /'
     Switch to the original playlist buffer (if it still exists).

23 Music Player Daemon
**********************

Emms provides an interface to the Music Player Daemon
(http://www.musicpd.org/)(MusicPD) software.  The package is called
'emms-player-mpd' and is provided by the file 'emms-player-mpd.el'.

   The advantages of using MusicPD as an Emms backend include the
following.

   * minimal CPU usage
   * fast access of track information
   * optional crossfade

Setup
-----

To load 'emms-player-mpd' invoke:

     (require 'emms-player-mpd)

   Set the variables EMMS-PLAYER-MPD-SERVER-NAME and
EMMS-PLAYER-MPD-SERVER-PORT to the location and port (respectively) of
your MusicPD server.  For example:

     (setq emms-player-mpd-server-name "localhost")
     (setq emms-player-mpd-server-port "6600")

   If your MusicPD setup requires a password, you will to set
EMMS-PLAYER-MPD-SERVER-PASSWORD as follows.

     (setq emms-player-mpd-server-password "mypassword")

   To get track information from MusicPD, invoke the following:

     (add-to-list 'emms-info-functions 'emms-info-mpd)

   Adding 'emms-player-mpd' to your Emms player list is accomplished by
invoking:

     (add-to-list 'emms-player-list 'emms-player-mpd)

   Unless your MusicPD is configured to use absolute file names, you
must set the emms-player-mpd-music-directory variable to the value of
'music_directory' in your MusicPD configuration.  There are additional
options available as well, but the defaults should be sufficient for
most uses.

   Once you've done the above, run the 'M-x emms-cache-set-from-mpd-all'
command to fill the Emms cache with the contents of your MusicPD
database.  The music in your MusicPD database should then be accessible
via the Emms browser.

   You can set EMMS-PLAYER-MPD-SYNC-PLAYLIST to nil if your master Emms
playlist contains only stored playlists.

Commands provided
-----------------

 -- Function: emms-player-mpd-connect
     Connect to MusicPD and retrieve its current playlist.  Afterward,
     the status of MusicPD will be tracked.

 -- Function: emms-player-mpd-disconnect
     Terminate the MusicPD client process and disconnect from MusicPD.

 -- Function: emms-player-mpd-show &optional insertp
     Describe the current Emms track in the minibuffer.  If INSERTP is
     non-nil, insert the description into the current buffer instead.
     This function uses EMMS-SHOW-FORMAT to format the current track.
     It differs from 'emms-show' in that it asks MusicPD for the current
     track, rather than Emms.

Updating the MusicPD database
.............................

 -- Function: emms-player-mpd-update-directory dir
     Cause the tracks in DIR to be updated in the MusicPD database.

 -- Function: emms-player-mpd-update-all
     Cause all tracks in the MusicPD music directory to be updated in
     the MusicPD database.

emms-cache.el integration
.........................

 -- Function: emms-cache-set-from-mpd-directory dir
     Dump all MusicPD data from DIR into the Emms cache.  This is useful
     to do when you have recently acquired new music.

 -- Function: emms-cache-set-from-mpd-all
     Dump all MusicPD data into the Emms cache.  This is useful to do
     once, just before using emms-browser.el, in order to prime the
     cache.

emms-volume.el integration
..........................

To activate this, add the following to your .emacs.

     (require 'emms-volume)
     (setq emms-volume-change-function 'emms-volume-mpd-change)

24 Lyrics
*********

We can display the lyrics of a song in time with the music using the
'emms-lyrics' package provided by the file 'emms-lyrics.el'.

   The lyrics files should have the extention ".lrc", and can be placed
under either the same directory as the music files or EMMS-LYRICS-DIR.

   To add this feature we invoke:

     (require 'emms-lyrics)
     (emms-lyrics 1)

   There are a number of variables we can set to define the way that
'emms-lyrics' behaves, we can set these directly or by using the
Customize feature in Emacs.

 -- User Option: emms-lyrics-display-on-minibuffer
     If non-nil, display lyrics on minibuffer.

 -- User Option: emms-lyrics-display-on-modeline
     If non-nil, display lyrics on modeline.

 -- User Option: emms-lyrics-dir
     Local lyrics repository.  'emms-lyrics-find-lyric' will look for
     lyrics in current directory(i.e., same as the music file) and this
     directory.

 -- User Option: emms-lyrics-display-format
     Format for displaying lyrics.  "%s" will be replaced by the lyrics
     string.

 -- User Option: emms-lyrics-coding-system
     Coding system used in the output of lyrics.

 -- User Option: emms-lyrics-scroll-p
     Non-nil value will enable lyrics scrolling.

 -- User Option: emms-lyrics-scroll-timer-interval
     Interval between scroller timers.  The shorter, the faster.

   We can control 'emms-lyrics' with the help of the following
functions:

 -- Function: emms-lyrics-start
     Start displaying lyrics.

 -- Function: emms-lyrics-stop
     Stop displaying lyrics.

 -- Function: emms-lyrics-toggle-display-on-minibuffer
     Toggle display lyrics on minibufer.

 -- Function: emms-lyrics-toggle-display-on-modeline
     Toggle display lyrics on mode line.

 -- Function: emms-lyrics-enable
     Enable displaying Emms lyrics.

 -- Function: emms-lyrics-disable
     Disable displaying Emms lyrics.

 -- Function: emms-lyrics-toggle
     Toggle displaying Emms lyrics.

25 Volume
*********

We can use the 'emms-volume' package, as provided by the
'emms-volume.el' file, to manipulate the volume.

 -- User Option: emms-volume-change-amount
     The amount to use when raising or lowering the volume using the
     emms-volume interface.

     This should be a positive integer.

 -- Function: emms-volume-raise
     Increase the volume.

 -- Function: emms-volume-lower
     Decrease the volume.

   If you feel like binding those two functions to global keys -- don't
do it or you'll miss the convenience of 'emms-volume-minor-mode'.
Instead, bind the following two commands to some keys that you like.

 -- Function: emms-volume-mode-plus
     Raise volume and enable or extend the 'emms-volume-minor-mode'
     timeout.

 -- Function: emms-volume-mode-minus
     Lower volume and enable or extend the 'emms-volume-minor-mode'
     timeout.

   Example:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c +") 'emms-volume-mode-plus)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c -") 'emms-volume-mode-minus)

   Whenever you use one of these keys or call these functions with
'M-x', Emms will be put into 'emms-volume-minor-mode' for a short period
defined by 'emms-volume-mode-timeout'.

 -- User Option: emms-volume-mode-timeout
     The timeout in amount of seconds used by 'emms-volume-minor-mode'.

   In this interval you can raise/lower the volume simply by pressing
'+' or '-', which will also reset the timer to its initial value.  So
instead of pressing 'C-c +' six times to increase volume by six steps of
'emms-volume-change-amount', you would simply type 'C-c + + + + + +'.

   Emms can change volume with amixer, mpd, PulseAudio out of the box,
see EMMS-VOLUME-CHANGE-FUNCTION.

26 Streaming Audio
******************

Emms provides a friendly interface for managing and playing streaming
audio in addition to the Emms playlist interface.  The interface is
defined in the 'emms-streams.el' package and can be loaded by invoking:

     (require 'emms-streams)

   Querying the streams for track information is provided by the
'emms-stream-info.el' package and can be loaded with:

     (require 'emms-stream-info)

   The Emms interface for streaming audio, and the stream query
capabilites are enabled by default in the 'emms-all' setup level.  For
more information about Emms setup levels see *Note Setup::.

   'emms-stream-info' calls a backend program to query the stream for
information.  The preferred program needs to be specified by setting the
variable EMMS-STREAM-INFO-BACKEND either 'mplayer', 'mpv' or 'vlc'.  For
instance:

     (setq emms-stream-info-backend 'vlc)

   Obviously, the corresponding program needs to be installed and
available for Emms to invoke.

   Enter the emms-streams interface by invoking 'M-x' 'emms-streams'.
The emms-streams interface comes with a built-in, eclectic list of
streaming audio channels from throughout the Web.  Emms can of-course
play other streams than the ones listed by default, you are free to
remove any or all of them and add your own.(1)

   The following is a list of the key-bindings for the emms-streams
interface:

'RET'
     Perform the default action when you press RET in the Emms Stream
     interface.  Can be either "add" or "play".  The default is "add",
     which adds the station under point to the Emms playlist.  When
     EMMS-STREAM-DEFAULT-ACTION is "play" then Emms will play the
     streaming audio channel under point.
'q'
     Quit the emms-streams interface.
'a'
     Add a bookmark to a streaming audio URL to the list.
'd'
     Remove a bookmark to a streaming audio URL from the list.
'e'
     Edit the details of the bookmark under point.
'h'
     Describe the emms-streams mode.
'n'
     Move to the next line in the emms-streams buffer (same as C-n).
'p'
     Move to the previous line in the emms-streams buffer (same as C-p).
's'
     Save the bookmarks in the emms-streams interface to disk.  The
     bookmarks will be to the location designated in the variable
     EMMS-STREAM-BOOKMARKS-FILE.
'i'
     Return information about the streaming audio at the URL of the
     bookmark under point.  Note that this will only work if the
     'emms-stream-info' has already been loaded.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you enjoy a particular streaming audio station on the Web and
think that it belongs in the default list, please send us a link and we
will gladly add it!

27 APE / FLAC Commands
**********************

Often, a single APE or FLAC file contains a complete ablum.  We can
still play next or previous track in the ablum with the help of
'emms-cue.el' package, provided there is a corresponding cue sheet file.
This package also defines 'emms-info-cueinfo' for retreiving the track
information for APE / FLAC itself.

   To load 'emms-cue.el':

     (require 'emms-cue)
     (add-to-list 'emms-info-functions 'emms-info-cueinfo)

 -- Function: emms-cue-next
     Play next track from .cue file
 -- Function: emms-cue-previous
     Play previous track from .cue file

28 Bookmarks
************

Emms can save a "temporal bookmark" in a media file via emms-bookmarks.
The file 'emms-bookmarks.el' provides the package emms-bookmarks.

   While some media is playing, invoking 'M-x emms-bookmarks-add' will
first pause the playback and then prompt for a name describing the
bookmark.  Tracks can have multiple bookmarks associated with them.

   To jump to the next and previous bookmarks in the current track
invoke 'M-x emms-bookmarks-next' and 'M-x emms-bookmarks-prev'
respectively.

   To clear all of the bookmarks for the current track invoke 'M-x
emms-bookmarks-clear'.

29 Managing Playlists
*********************

Emms can have multiple playlists, since a playlist is just another
buffer with a list of tracks.  You can manage multiple playlists using
'emms-metaplaylist-mode', provided by the file 'emms-metaplaylist-mode'.

   Start the playlist manager with 'M-x emms-metaplaylist-mode-go'.  The
playlist manager will list the playlists and mark the current one.  The
following commands are available:

'RET'
     Make the buffer at point the Emms playlist buffer and switch to it.

'SPC'
     Make the buffer at point the Emms playlist buffer (but do not
     switch to it).

'n'
     Move point to the next playlist.

'p'
     Move point to the previous playlist.

'g'
     Update the playlist manager buffer.

'C'

30 GNU FM
*********

GNU FM (https://www.gnu.org/software/gnufm/) is free software for
running music community websites.  It was created for the music
community site, Libre.fm (http://libre.fm/).

   Emms can send track information, and stream music from GNU FM servers
using 'emms-librefm-scrobbler.el' and 'emms-librefm-stream.el',
respectively.

   Emms is configured by default to use Libre.fm (http://libre.fm/), but
can work with any GNU FM server by configuring the variable
EMMS-LIBREFM-SCROBBLER-HANDSHAKE-URL to the URL of the GNU FM server.

   The recommended way of providing your credentials to the GNU FM
server is by using an authinfo file.  Add authentication to your
auth-info file, typically '~/.authinfo.gpg', as:
     machine libre.fm login USERNAME password PASSWORD
   If you are using some other server than libre.fm, change "'libre.fm'"
to match EMMS-LIBREFM-SCROBBLER-HANDSHAKE-URL.

   Alternatively, you can save the password in plaintext in your
init-file by setting these variables:

     (setq emms-librefm-scrobbler-username "USERNAME"
           emms-librefm-scrobbler-password "PASSWORD")

* Menu:

* Uploading Track Information:: How to submit listened track information.
* GNU FM Streaming:: Streaming music from a GNU FM server.

30.1 Uploading Track Information
================================

GNU FM servers, such as Libre.fm can optionally store a user's listening
habits using information sent to the website's server from the Emms.  By
utilizing the records of users' listening habits, the website aims to be
able to recommend music to users by analyzing their musical taste.

   Load the feature into Emms with:

     (require 'emms-librefm-scrobbler)

   This feature can also be enabled via *Note Setup::, in the 'emms-all'
setup level.

   Enable uploading the details of the tracks Emms plays to the GNU FM
server with 'emms-librefm-scrobbler-enable'.  The track's details will
be uploaded to the server when the track's playback ends.  You can
disable this behavior with 'emms-librefm-scrobbler-disable'.

30.2 GNU FM Streaming
=====================

If the GNU FM server provides a streaming music service you can take
advantage of it by loading:

     (require 'emms-librefm-stream)

   This feature can also be enabled via *Note Setup::, in the 'emms-all'
setup level.

   Then invoke 'emms-librefm-stream' and enter the URL of the station
you wish to listen to, for example "librefm://globaltags/Classical".

GNU General Public License
**************************

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program-to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified
     version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
     that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
     which an implementation is available to the public in source code
     form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities.  However, it does not include the
     work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
     with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
     libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
     its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges
     your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
     copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
     or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
     that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
     material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making
     or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
     behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
     them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
     their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
     limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
          written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
          the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
          you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
          object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
          needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
     a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
     by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
     modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the
     modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation
     of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
     terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
     third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
     for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
     of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
     interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
     efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
     of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
     litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
     alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
     selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
     of it.

  11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor
     version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control"
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
     version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To "grant"
     such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
     commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
     you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
     activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
     grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
     from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
     copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
     those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
     products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
     entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
     prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
     or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
     do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
     cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
     obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
     then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example,
     if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
     further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
     only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
     be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
     number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

31 GNU Free Documentation License
*********************************

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
     so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.

31.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
=========================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
