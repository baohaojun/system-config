;;; Commentary:

;; This file defines a few simple functions to raise or lower the volume
;; using amixer. It can be used stand-alone, though it's meant for usage
;; with EMMS, particularly with emms-volume.el

;;; History:

;; May 30 2006: First cleanup and collation of amixer functions into a
;;              separate file for releasability.

;;; Todo:

;; There probably needs to be more configurability, which may in turn
;; mean adding some more functions.
;; Some of this could benefit from adding customize interfaces.

;;; Code:

(defcustom emms-volume-amixer-control "Master"
  "The control to change the volume with.
Controls includes \"Master\", \"PCM\", etc. For a full list of available
controls, run `amixer controls' in a shell."
  :type '(choice (const :tag "Master" "Master")
                 (const :tag "PCM" "PCM")
                 (string :tag "Something else: "))
  :group 'emms-volume)

(defcustom emms-volume-amixer-card 0
  "The card number to change volume.
The card is identified by a number. For a full list run `cat
/proc/asound/cards' in a shell."
  :type 'integer
  :group 'emms-volume)

;;;###autoload
(defun emms-volume-amixer-change (amount)
  "Change amixer master volume by AMOUNT."
  (message "Playback channels: %s"
           (with-temp-buffer
             (when (zerop
                    (call-process "amixer" nil (current-buffer) nil
				  "-c"
				  (format "%d" emms-volume-amixer-card)
                                  "sset" emms-volume-amixer-control
                                  (format "%d%%%s" (abs amount)
                                          (if (< amount 0) "-" "+"))))
               (if (re-search-backward "\\[\\([0-9]+%\\)\\]" nil t)
