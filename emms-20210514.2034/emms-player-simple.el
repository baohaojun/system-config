;;; Commentary:

;; This is a simple player interface - if you have an external player
;; that just expects the filename to play as an argument, this should
;; be able to use it. See the define-emms-simple-player lines at the
;; end of this file for examples.

;; Add the following to your `emms-player-list':

;; emms-player-mpg321
;; emms-player-ogg123
