;;; Commentary:

;; Saves all playlists when you close emacs.  When you start it up again use
;; M-x emms-history-load to restore all saved playlists.

;; To use it put the following into your ~/.emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'emms-history)
;;
;; If all playlists should be restored on startup add this, too:
;;
;;   (emms-history-load)
