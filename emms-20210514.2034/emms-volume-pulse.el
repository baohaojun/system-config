;;; Commentary:

;; This file defines a few simple functions to raise or lower the volume
;; using pactl. It can be used stand-alone, though it's meant for usage
;; with EMMS, particularly with emms-volume.el.
;;
;; To use add the following to your EMMS configuration
;;     (setq emms-volume-change-function 'emms-volume-pulse-change)

;;; History:

;; Marts 2015: First release.  Partly based on emms-volume-amixer.el

;;; Todo:

;; There probably needs to be more configurability, which may in turn
;; mean adding some more functions.
;; Some of this could benefit from adding customize interfaces.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)

;; TODO: it would be great if custom could have
;; choices based on pactl list short sinks | cut -f1-2
