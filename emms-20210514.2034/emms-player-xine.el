;;; Commentary:

;; This provides a player that uses xine. It supports pause and
;; seeking.

;;; Code:

;; TODO: The video window cannot be disabled. I asked on
;; gmane.comp.video.xine.user (<87y7ohqcbq.fsf@baldur.tsdh.de>)...

;; TODO: Implement seek-to with "SetPositionX%\n" where X is in {0,10,..,90}
