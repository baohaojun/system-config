;;; Commentary:
;;
;; You can use this to add ``temporal bookmarks'' (term by Lucas
;; Bonnet) to your media files.  The interesting functions here are
;; `emms-bookmarks-next', `emms-bookmarks-prev', `emms-bookmarks-add'
;; (which pauses the player while you describe the bookmark) and
;; `emms-bookmarks-clear'.  All of which do exactly what you think
;; they do.
