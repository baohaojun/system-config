;;; Commentary:

;;; Benefits of MusicPD

;; MusicPD features crossfade, very little skipping, minor CPU usage,
;; many clients, many supported output formats, fast manipulation via
;; network processes, and good abstraction of client and server.

;;; MusicPD setup

;; If you want to set up a local MusicPD server, you'll need to have
;; mpd installed.  If you want to use a remote server instance, no
;; installation is needed.

;; The website is at http://musicpd.org/.  Debian packages are
;; available.  It is recommended to use mpd version 0.12.0 or higher.
;;
;; Copy the example configuration for mpd into ~/.mpdconf and edit it
;; to your needs.  Use your top level music directory for
;; music_directory.  If your playlists use absolute file names, be
;; certain that music_directory has the leading directory part.
;;
;; Before you try to play anything, but after setting up the above,
;; run `mkdir ~/.mpd && mpd --create-db' to create MusicPD's track
;; database.
;;
;; Check to see if mpd is running.  It must be running as a daemon for
;; you to be able to play anything.  Launch it by executing "mpd".  It
;; can be killed later with "mpd --kill" (or just "killall mpd" if
;; you're not using the latest development version).

;;; EMMS setup

;; Add the following to your config.
;;
;; (require 'emms-player-mpd)

;; Adjust `emms-player-mpd-server-name' and
;; `emms-player-mpd-server-port' to match the location and port of
;; your MusicPD server.
;;
;;   (setq emms-player-mpd-server-name "localhost")
;;   (setq emms-player-mpd-server-port "6600")

;; If your MusicPD setup requires a password, you will need to do the
;; following.
;;
;;   (setq emms-player-mpd-server-password "mypassword")

;; To get track info from MusicPD, do the following.
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'emms-info-functions #'emms-info-mpd)

;; To change the volume using MusicPD, do the following.
;;
;;   (setq emms-volume-change-function #'emms-volume-mpd-change)

;; Add 'emms-player-mpd to the top of `emms-player-list'.
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'emms-player-list 'emms-player-mpd)

;; If you use absolute file names in your m3u playlists (which is most
;; likely), make sure you set `emms-player-mpd-music-directory' to the
;; value of "music_directory" from your MusicPD config.  There are
;; additional options available as well, but the defaults should be
;; sufficient for most uses.

;; You can set `emms-player-mpd-sync-playlist' to nil if your master
;; EMMS playlist contains only stored playlists.

;; If at any time you wish to replace the current EMMS playlist buffer
;; with the contents of the MusicPD playlist, type
;; M-x emms-player-mpd-connect.
;;
;; This will also run the relevant seek functions, so that if you use
;; emms-playing-time, the displayed time will be accurate.

;;; Contributors

;; Adam Sj√∏gren implemented support for changing the volume.
