;;; Commentary:

;; 2019-11-05 - This is a complete re-write of the emms-streams.el,
;; using a different approach.

;; This includes the built-in list of streams which come with Emms by
;; default. Emms has no affiliation of any kind with the streaming
;; audio stations listed below, nor is this an endorsement of these
;; stations. Instead, this is a collection of stations submitted to
;; the project over the years by people who enjoy Emms. We hope you
;; will enjoy them too.

;;; Code:

(require 'emms)
(require 'emms-source-playlist)
(require 'emms-playlist-mode)
