  "Specifies date format depending on when a track was last played.
This is an alist of items (AGE . FORMAT).  AGE can be a number (of
seconds) or a Lisp expression evaluating to a number.  When the age of
the track is less than this number, then use `format-time-string'
with the corresponding FORMAT for displaying the date of the track.
If AGE is not a number or a Lisp expression evaluating to a
non-number, then the corresponding FORMAT is used as a default value.

Note that the list is processed from the beginning, so it should be
sorted by ascending AGE.  Also note that items following the first
non-number AGE will be ignored.

You can use the functions `emms-last-played-seconds-today',
`emms-last-played-seconds-month' and
`emms-last-played-seconds-year' in the AGE spec.  They return the
number of seconds passed since the start of today, of this month,
of this year, respectively.")
