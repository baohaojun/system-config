;;; See the BBDB info manual for documentation.

;; Changes in `bbdb-file-format':
;;   3  Date format for `creation-date' and `timestamp' changed
;;      from "dd mmm yy" (ex: 25 Sep 97) to "yyyy-mm-dd" (ex: 1997-09-25).
;;   4  Country field added.
;;   5  Streets are lists.
;;   6  Postcodes are plain strings.
;;   7  New field `affix'.  Organizations are a list.
;;      Xfields is always a list.
;;  (8  Skipped format in "official BBDB": Some BBDB users introduced
;;      an xfield uuid in their format 8.  To bring them back, we jump
;;      straight from 7 to 9.)
;;   9  New field uuid.  Make `creation-date' and `timestamp' immutable fields.
