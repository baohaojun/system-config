  "Search RECORDS for fields matching SPEC.
The following keywords are supported in SPEC to search fields in RECORDS
matching the regexps RE:

:name RE          Match RE against first-last name.
:name-fl RE       Match RE against last-first name.
:all-names RE     Match RE against first-last, last-first, and aka.
:affix RE         Match RE against affixes.
:aka RE           Match RE against akas.
:organization RE  Match RE against organizations.
:mail RE          Match RE against mail addresses.
:xfield RE        Match RE against `bbdb-default-xfield'.
                  RE may also be a cons (LABEL . REGEXP).
                  Then REGEXP is matched against xfield LABEL.
                  If LABEL is '* then RE is matched against all xfields.
:creation-date RE Match RE against creation-date.
:timestamp RE     Match RE against timestamp.

Each of these keywords may appear multiple times.
Other keywords:

:bool FUN         Combine the search for multiple fields using FUN.
                  FUN must be a function that takes as many arguments
                  as there are search keywords in SPEC, for example
                  `or' (match either field, the default)
                  or `and' (match all fields).
:invert VAL       Invert the search if VAL is non-nil.
                  The default is the return value of `bbdb-search-invert-p'.
:case-fold VAL    Searches ignore case if VAL is non-nil.
                  The default is the value of `bbdb-case-fold-search'.

See also `bbdb-message-search' for fast searches using `bbdb-hashtable'
but not allowing for regexps.

For backward compatibility, SPEC may also consist of the optional args
  NAME ORGANIZATION MAIL XFIELD PHONE ADDRESS
which is equivalent to
  :all-names NAME :organization ORGANIZATION :mail MAIL
  :xfield XFIELD :phone PHONE :address ADDRESS
This usage is discouraged."
