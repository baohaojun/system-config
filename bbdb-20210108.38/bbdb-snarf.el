;;; Commentary:

;; The commands `bbdb-snarf', `bbdb-snarf-yank' and `bbdb-snarf-paragraph'
;; create BBDB records by picking the name, addresses, phones, etc.
;; out of a (buffer) string.  Things are recognized by context (e.g., URLs
;; start with http:// or www.).  See `bbdb-snarf-rule-alist' for details.
;;
;; The rule `eu' should work out of the box for many continental
;; European countries.  It can be further customized by defining
;; a suitable postcode regexp passed to `bbdb-snarf-address-eu'.
;; `mail' is a simple rule that can pick a single mail address from,
;; say, a long list of mail addresses in a message.
;;
;; RW: `bbdb-snarf' is an interesting proof of concept.  Yet I find
;; its snarfing algorithms often too simplistic to be useful in real life.
;; How can this possibly be improved?  Suggestions welcome.

  "Alist of rules for snarfing.
Each rule is of the form (KEY FUNCTION FUNCTION ...).
The symbol KEY identifies the rule, see also `bbdb-snarf-rule-default'.

Snarfing is a cumulative process.  The text is copied to a temporary
snarf buffer that becomes current during snarfing.
Each FUNCTION is called with one arg, the RECORD we are snarfing,
and with point at the beginning of the snarf buffer.  FUNCTION should populate
the fields of RECORD.  It may delete the part of the snarf buffer
that it has processed so that the remaining FUNCTIONs operate only
on those parts that were not yet snarfed.  The order of the FUNCTION calls
in a rule is then crucial.
Unlike other parts of BBDB, FUNCTIONs need not update the cache and
hash table for RECORD which is done at the end by `bbdb-snarf'."
