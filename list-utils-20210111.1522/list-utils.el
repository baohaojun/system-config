;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; List-utils is a collection of functions for list manipulation.
;; This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful
;; for programming in Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; Notable functionality includes
;;
;;     * `list-utils-flatten', a robust list-flattener which handles
;;       cyclic lists, non-nil-terminated lists, and preserves nils
;;       when they are found as list elements.
;;
;;     * `tconc', a simple data structure for efficiently appending
;;       to a list
;;
;; The following functions are provided:
;;
;;     `make-tconc'
;;     `tconc-p'
;;     `tconc-list'
;;     `tconc'
;;     `list-utils-cons-cell-p'
;;     `list-utils-cyclic-length'
;;     `list-utils-improper-p'
;;     `list-utils-make-proper-copy'
;;     `list-utils-make-proper-inplace'
;;     `list-utils-make-improper-copy'
;;     `list-utils-make-improper-inplace'
;;     `list-utils-linear-p'
;;     `list-utils-linear-subseq'
;;     `list-utils-cyclic-p'
;;     `list-utils-cyclic-subseq'
;;     `list-utils-make-linear-copy'
;;     `list-utils-make-linear-inplace'
;;     `list-utils-safe-length'
;;     `list-utils-safe-equal'
;;     `list-utils-depth'
;;     `list-utils-flat-length'
;;     `list-utils-flatten'
;;     `list-utils-alist-or-flat-length'
;;     `list-utils-alist-flatten'
;;     `list-utils-insert-before'
;;     `list-utils-insert-after'
;;     `list-utils-insert-before-pos'
;;     `list-utils-insert-after-pos'
;;     `list-utils-and'
;;     `list-utils-not'
;;     `list-utils-xor'
;;     `list-utils-uniq'
;;     `list-utils-dupes'
;;     `list-utils-singlets'
;;     `list-utils-partition-dupes'
;;     `list-utils-plist-reverse'
;;     `list-utils-plist-del'
;;
;; To use list-utils, place the list-utils.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'list-utils)
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     This library includes an implementation of the classic Lisp
;;     `tconc' which is outside the "list-utils-" namespace.
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements
;;
;;     No external dependencies
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     @@@ spin out hash-table tests into separate library
;;
;;     test cyclic inputs to all
;;     test improper inputs to all
;;     test single-element lists as inputs to all
;;     test cyclic single-element lists as inputs to all
;;
;;     should list-utils-make-improper-inplace accept nil as a special case?
;;
;;     could do -copy/-inplace variants for more functions, consider doing
;;     so for flatten
;;
;;     list* returns a non-list on single elt, our function throws an error

Order will follow LIST1.  Duplicates may be present in the result

TEST is an optional comparison function in the form of a

See `define-hash-table-test' to define your own tests.

HINT is an optional micro-optimization, predicting the size of

When optional FLIP is set, the sense of the comparison is
reversed.  When FLIP is set, LIST2 will be the guide for the
order of the result, and will determine whether duplicates may
be returned.  Since this function preserves duplicates, setting
FLIP can change the number of elements in the result.

Performance: `list-utils-and' and friends use a general-purpose
hashing approach.  `intersection' and friends use pure iteration.
Iteration can be much faster in a few special cases, especially
when the number of elements is small.  In other scenarios,
iteration can be much slower.  Hashing has no worst-case
performance scenario, although it uses much more memory.  For
heavy-duty list operations, performance may be improved by
`let'ing `gc-cons-threshold' to a high value around sections that
make frequent use of this function."
