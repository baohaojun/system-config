Return the elements of LIST1 which are present in LIST2.

the cl library, except that `list-utils-and' preserves order,
does not uniquify the results, and exhibits more predictable
performance for large lists.

Order will follow LIST1.  Duplicates may be present in the result
as in LIST1.

TEST is an optional comparison function in the form of a
hash-table-test.  The default is `equal'.  Other valid values
include `eq' (built-in), `eql' (built-in), `list-utils-htt-='
\(numeric), `list-utils-htt-case-fold-equal' (case-insensitive).
See `define-hash-table-test' to define your own tests.

HINT is an optional micro-optimization, predicting the size of
the list to be hashed (LIST2 unless FLIP is set).

When optional FLIP is set, the sense of the comparison is
reversed.  When FLIP is set, LIST2 will be the guide for the
order of the result, and will determine whether duplicates may
be returned.  Since this function preserves duplicates, setting
FLIP can change the number of elements in the result.

Performance: `list-utils-and' and friends use a general-purpose
hashing approach.  `intersection' and friends use pure iteration.
Iteration can be much faster in a few special cases, especially
when the number of elements is small.  In other scenarios,
iteration can be much slower.  Hashing has no worst-case
performance scenario, although it uses much more memory.  For
heavy-duty list operations, performance may be improved by
`let'ing `gc-cons-threshold' to a high value around sections that
make frequent use of this function.
