# Set port to the physical port used to connect to your phone.
# Linux version is:
#
# For MacOSX you will need something like:
# port = /dev/cu.USA28X1P1.1
#
# For Win32 you want to use:
# port = com1:
# or similiar.
#
# FreeBSD (probably NetBSD and OpenBSD too) use:
# port = /dev/cuaa0
#
# With Linux-IrDA you will want to use
# port = /dev/ircomm0
# or similiar.
#
# Use this setting also for the Bluetooth connection:
# port = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
# when using it with AT driver set it to:
# port = /dev/rfcomm0
# or similiar.
#
# For the Linux USB cables you will need one of the following settings (or
# similiar)
# port = /dev/ttyUSB0
# port = /dev/tts/USB0
port = /dev/ttyACM0
# the last one will work only with AT driver. The correct setting should be
# given in the dmesg output.
#
# If you use connection type dku2libusb use it to denote which use endpoint
# you'd wish to use. It is useful when you have more than one phone connected
# to your computer using DKU2 cable. Numbering goes from 1 upwards.
# Default is 1.
# port = 1

# Set model to the model number of your phone. For the
# Symbian phones use:
model = AT
# For other non-Nokia phones and when you want to use AT
# mode use:
# model = AT
# If you can't figure out what to put here read the FAQ.
# If it still doesn't help, consult gnokii-ml or #gnokii at freenode.
# model = 6510
# There are few main models that should make use of the certain drivers.
# These are: 6110, 7110, 6510, 3110, 2110, 6160.

# Set IrDA device name.
# If you use irda connection you may want gnokii to autodetect the irda
# device it connects to. This is fine for most of the cases. if you have
# more than one device in range you may want to give manually the device
# name so gnokii correctly recognizes it. Use the name that you can see
# in the discovery log when the phone with infrared is in the range of
# your irda port.
# Note that you need to set this for each phone_ section separately. It
# isn't nested from the global section.
# irda_string = Nokia 6610i

# Initlength controls the number of characters sent to the
# phone during initialisation.  You can either set it to
# the word "default" or a positive integer.
#
# You can try setting this value if you want to connect
# to the phone quicker.  If you've never noticed the
# connection to be slow, it is suggested that you
# leave this alone.  Read the initialisation code in fbus-xxxx
# to understand what this changes if you're curious.

# The type of the connection, for IR set this to infrared or irda.
# For the nk6110 driver only infrared is valid for the IrDA connection.
# See Docs/gnokii-ir-howto for more detailes on this.
# If you have 6210/6250/7110 phone and dau9p cable (the one you can
# use with 6100 series and cannot use hardware modem from the phone)
# you may want to use 'dau9p' value to get faster initialization.
# If you use dlr3 or dlr3p cable for nokia phones in FBUS mode (ie.
# you don't use model = AT) you may want to use 'dlr3p' value here.
# Note that it is recommended and currently the best way to use this
# cable with nk6510 driver.
connection = serial
# With DKU-2 cable use the following setting if you want to libusb driver
# (recommended):
# connection = dku2libusb
# or the following setting if you want to use Linux kernel driver
# connection = dku2
# With DKU-5 cable use the following setting
# connection = dku5
# For Bluetooth and AT driver use the following setting
# connection = serial
# For other Bluetooth settings use
# connection = bluetooth
# For infrared connection with phones other than Nokia 6110/6130/6150 use:
# connection = irda
# Don't forget to run: 'irattach irda0 -s' or similiar before running gnokii
# For connection with a PC/SC compatible Smart Card reader use:
# connection = pcsc

# Set this to 'yes' if you want gnokii to set and check the lock file in
# /var/lock directory. It avoids potential conflicts with other serial
# port software (eg. minicom). If you have wrong permissions for the
# directory, a warning will be generated. If you don't want a lockfile, set
# it to 'no'.

# There may happen various timeouts during the communication with the phone.

# that it received the short message. When the SMSC is DoSed with many requests
