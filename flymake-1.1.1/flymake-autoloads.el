(autoload 'flymake-mode "flymake" "\
Toggle Flymake mode on or off.

If called interactively, enable Flymake mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it if ARG is zero or negative.  If called from Lisp,
also enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it if
ARG is `toggle'; disable the mode otherwise.

Flymake is an Emacs minor mode for on-the-fly syntax checking.
Flymake collects diagnostic information from multiple sources,
called backends, and visually annotates the buffer with the
results.

Flymake performs these checks while the user is editing.
The customization variables `flymake-start-on-flymake-mode',
`flymake-no-changes-timeout' determine the exact circumstances
whereupon Flymake decides to initiate a check of the buffer.

The commands `flymake-goto-next-error' and
`flymake-goto-prev-error' can be used to navigate among Flymake
diagnostics annotated in the buffer.

The visual appearance of each type of diagnostic can be changed
by setting properties `flymake-overlay-control', `flymake-bitmap'
and `flymake-severity' on the symbols of diagnostic types (like
`:error', `:warning' and `:note').

Activation or deactivation of backends used by Flymake in each
buffer happens via the special hook
`flymake-diagnostic-functions'.

Some backends may take longer than others to respond or complete,
and some may decide to disable themselves if they are not
suitable for the current buffer.  The commands
`flymake-running-backends', `flymake-disabled-backends' and
`flymake-reporting-backends' summarize the situation, as does the
special *Flymake log* buffer.
