(autoload 'jedi:start-dedicated-server "jedi-core" "\
Start Jedi server dedicated to this buffer.
This is useful, for example, when you want to use different
`sys.path' for some buffer.  When invoked as an interactive
command, it asks you how to start the Jedi server.  You can edit
the command in minibuffer to specify the way Jedi server run.

If you want to setup how Jedi server is started programmatically
per-buffer/per-project basis, make `jedi:server-command' and
`jedi:server-args' buffer local and set it in `python-mode-hook'.
See also: `jedi:server-args'.

Fully setup jedi.el for current buffer.
It setups `ac-sources' or `company-backends' and turns
`jedi-mode' on.

This function is intended to be called from `python-mode-hook',
like this::

       (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'jedi:setup)

You can also call this function as a command, to quickly test
what jedi can do." t nil)

(autoload 'jedi:install-server "jedi-core" "\
This command installs Jedi server script jediepcserver.py in a
Python environment dedicated to Emacs.  By default, the
environment is at ``~/.emacs.d/.python-environments/default/``.
This environment is automatically created by ``virtualenv`` if it
does not exist.

Run this command (i.e., type ``M-x jedi:install-server RET``)
whenever Jedi.el shows a message to do so.  It is a good idea to
run this every time after you update Jedi.el to sync version of
Python modules used by Jedi.el and Jedi.el itself.

You can modify the location of the environment by changing
`jedi:environment-root' and/or `python-environment-directory'.  More
specifically, Jedi.el will install Python modules under the directory
``PYTHON-ENVIRONMENT-DIRECTORY/JEDI:ENVIRONMENT-ROOT``.  Note that you
need command line program ``virtualenv``.  If you have the command in
an unusual location, use `python-environment-virtualenv' to specify the
location.

.. NOTE:: jediepcserver.py is installed in a virtual environment but it
   does not mean Jedi.el cannot recognize the modules in virtual
   environment you are using for your Python development.  Jedi
   EPC server recognize the virtualenv it is in (i.e., the
   environment variable ``VIRTUAL_ENV`` in your Emacs) and then
   add modules in that environment to its ``sys.path``.  You can
   also add ``--virtual-env PATH/TO/ENV`` to `jedi:server-args'
   to include modules of virtual environment even you launch
   Emacs outside of the virtual environment.

.. NOTE:: It is highly recommended to use this command to install
   Python modules for Jedi.el.  You still can install Python
   modules used by Jedi.el manually.  However, you are then
   responsible for keeping Jedi.el and Python modules compatible.
