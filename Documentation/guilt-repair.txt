NAME

guilt-repair - Repair the repository state

SYNOPSIS
--------
include::usage-guilt-repair.txt[]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Perform various repository repairs. You must specify one mode of repair:

--full::
	Tries to repair everything possible. Additionally, it resets the
	repository state by reseting the HEAD to what's believed to be the
	proper commit, and reseting the applied stack. The end result should
	be a repository with no patches applied.

	WARNING: Running this command may result in commits and working
	directory changes being lost. You may want to create a new reference
	(e.g., branch, or reflog) to the original HEAD before using
	guilt-repair.

--status::
	Upgrade the status file from old format to new.
