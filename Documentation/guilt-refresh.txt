NAME
----
guilt-refresh - Refresh topmost applied patch

SYNOPSIS
--------
include::usage-guilt-refresh.txt[]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Refresh topmost applied patch with changes in the working copy.

OPTIONS
-------
--git::
	Generate a patch which uses all the features offered by the git diff
	format (e.g., rename and copy detection).

--diffstat::
Include a diffstat output in the patch file. Useful for cases where
patches will be submitted with other tools.
+
If the command line option is omitted, the corresponding git-config
option "guilt.diffstat" will be queried. So this would enable diffstat
output by default:

	git config --global guilt.diffstat true
