.SH "NAME"
guilt \- quilt on top of git
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIguilt\fR COMMAND [ARGS]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Andrew Morton originally developed a set of scripts for maintaining kernel patches outside of any SCM tool\&. Others extended these into a suite called quilt\&. The basic idea behind quilt is to maintain patches instead of maintaining source files\&. Patches can be added, removed or reordered, and they can be refreshed as you fix bugs or update to a new base revision\&. quilt is very powerful, but it is not integrated with the underlying SCM tools\&. This makes it difficult to visualize your changes\&.

Guilt allows one to use quilt functionality on top of a Git repository\&. Changes are maintained as patches which are committed into Git\&. Commits can be removed or reordered, and the underlying patch can be refreshed based on changes made in the working directory\&. The patch directory can also be placed under revision control, so you can have a separate history of changes made to your patches\&.
.SH "PATCHES DIRECTORY"
In Guilt, all the patches are stored in \&.git/patches/$branch/, where $branch is the name of the branch being worked on\&. This means that one can have a independent series of patches for each branch present in the repository\&. Each of these per\-branch directories contains 3 special files:

guards: This file contains any guards that should be applied to the series when pushing\&. It is only present when guards are selected\&.

series: This file contains a list of all the patch filenames relative to the per\-branch patch directory\&. Empty and commented out lines are ignored\&.

status: This file contains the state of the stack\&. What patches are applied\&.
.SH "HOOKS"
Any guilt operation may execute zero or more hook scripts which can be used to run any housekeeping commands or even abort the execution of the command\&.
.SH "HOOKS DIRECTORY"
Guilt follows the same basic design of hooks in Git itself\&. All Guilt hooks are executable files (generally shell scripts, but they can be anything the operating system can execute) in \&.git/hooks/guilt/\&.

The following hooks are supported:
.PP
delete <patch name>
.RS 4
Executed when a patch is deleted from the patch series via \fBguilt-delete\fR(1)\&.
