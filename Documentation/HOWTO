Since guilt is heavily based on Mercurial queues (mq), some of the following
is shamelessly stolen from the mq page [1].

Introduction:
=============

Andrew Morton originally developed a set of scripts for maintaining kernel
patches outside of any SCM tool. Others extended these into a suite called
quilt [2]. The basic idea behind quilt is to maintain patches instead of
maintaining source files. Patches can be added, removed or reordered, and
they can be refreshed as you fix bugs or update to a new base revision.
quilt is very powerful, but it is not integrated with the underlying SCM
tools. This makes it difficult to visualize your changes.

Guilt allows one to use quilt functionality on top of a Git repository.
Changes are maintained as patches which are committed into Git.  Commits can
be removed or reordered, and the underlying patch can be refreshed based on
changes made in the working directory. The patch directory can also be
placed under revision control, so you can have a separate history of changes
made to your patches.


Patches Directory:
==================

In Guilt, all the patches are stored in .git/patches/$branch/, where $branch
is the name of the branch being worked on. This means that one can have a
independent series of patches for each branch present in the repository.
Each of these per-branch directories contains 2 special files:

series: This file contains a list of all the patch filenames relative to the
per-branch patch directory. Empty and commented out lines are ignored.

status: This file contains the state of the stack. What patches are applied.


Diving in:
==========

This section is mostly for those savvy enough to just dive in, and not read
documentation ;) A more detailed description of what is going on is below.

$ cd some_git_repo

# initialize the patch directory
$ guilt-init

# create a new patch called 'patch1'
$ guilt-new patch1

# edit somefile
$ vim somefile

# refresh patch1 with the changes we just made
$ guilt-refresh

# If we look at .git/patches/$branch/patch1, we see a diff with the changes
# we just made

# create a new patch called 'patch2'
$ guilt-new patch2

# edit somefile again
$ vim somefile

# refresh patch2
$ guilt-refresh

# list all applied patches
$ guilt-applied

# list all applied and unapplied patches
$ guilt-series

# pop the top most applied patch
$ guilt-pop

# push the next patch on top of the currently applied patches
$ guilt-push

# pop all patches
$ guilt-pop -a

# push all patches
$ guilt-push -a


Why use Guilt?
==============

The quilt pdf [3] paper seems to be a good starting point for why use a
quilt-like system. As to why use Guilt over other quilt-like git porceilans,
that's mostly up to:

1) User's taste
2) Format of the patches directory


Working with Guilt:
===================

First, get a repository to work on. Here's one that we'll use as an example:
$ git-clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/jsipek/guilt-hello.git

Now, it is time to initialize the patches directory using guilt's init
command:
$ cd hello
$ guilt-init

Create a new patch called "new_hello_string"
$ guilt-new new_hello_string

This creates a new empty file .git/patches/master/new_hello_string.

Now, it is time to change hello.c. Suppose we change the string being
outputed to "Howdy!\n".

Currently, the changes live in the working copy only. Running refresh
refreshes the (currently empty) patch:
$ guilt-refresh

If we look at the patch file again, we'll see that it now contains a patch
that changes the hello string.

Let's create a second patch called "say_name"
$ guilt-new say_name

...and edit hello.c to output the programs name by adding:

printf("My name is '%s'\n", argv[0]);

And of course, we refresh the patch:
$ guilt-refresh

As you might have expected, this updates the second patch file with the
appropriate diff.
