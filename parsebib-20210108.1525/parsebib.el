  "Inheritance scheme for BibLaTeX cross-referencing.
Inheritances are specified for pairs of source and target entry
type, where the target is the cross-referencing entry and the
source the cross-referenced entry.  Each pair specifies the
fields in the source and the fields in the target that they
correspond with.

Inheritances valid for all entry types are defined by specifying
the entry type as \"all\".  The entry type may also be a
comma-separated list of entry types.

If no inheritance rule is set up for a given entry type+field
combination, the field inherits from the same-name field in the
cross-referenced entry.  If no inheritance should take place, the
target field is set to the symbol `none'.")

;; valid in BibTeX keys, they may nonetheless be problematic, because they are
;; special for TeX.  The difference between `parsebib--bibtex-identifier' and

;; fact not be necessary (or desirable) to distinguish the two, but until
