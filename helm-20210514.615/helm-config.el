;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Requiring this file is not needed when using a package manager to
;; install helm as this one will take care of loading the autoload
;; file.

;;; Code:

;;; Load the autoload file
;;  It should have been generated either by
;;  the package manager or the make file.

(load "helm-autoloads" nil t)

(provide 'helm-config)

;;; helm-config.el ends here
