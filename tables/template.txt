### Description
DESCRIPTION = This is a template engine table for IBus Table.

### Supported languages of this table
### sigle "zh_CN" just be recognized as zh_CN,
### but "zh_CN, zh_HK" or more zh_XX will be recognized as zh;
### and "en_US, zh_CN" will be just ignored.

### Layout

### The max number of input keys for every phrase or character.
MAX_KEY_LENGTH = 4

### Use auto_commit mode as default
AUTO_COMMIT = FALSE

### Use full width punctuation by default
DEF_FULL_WIDTH_PUNCT = TRUE
### Not use full width letter by default
DEF_FULL_WIDTH_LETTER = FALSE

### Whether user are allow to define phrase, default is true
### You have to define the word construction rules below.
### For input methods which do not input phrases, set this to False
USER_CAN_DEFINE_PHRASE = TRUE

### Whether support PinYin Mode, default is true.
### this feature is just for Chinese, set it to False if your IM is not
### Chinese.
PINYIN_MODE = TRUE

### If true then the phrases' frequencies will be adjusted dynamically
### according your using frequency.

### Some characters whose frequencies should be fix all the time, e.g. 
### some punctuations
### NO_CHECK_CHARS = 

### Rules for constructing user defined phrase
### "ce" stands for "ci equal", a Chinese English :), means "phrase length
### equal to", thus ce2 -> phrase length equal to 2; and "ca" means "phrase
### length equal or above", so ca4 -> phrase length equal or above 4.
### p21 -> the 1st key of 2nd character in the phrase, and so on.
### Each rule separate via ";". 
### Example below is a complete rule-set, 
### becuase [2,2] ∩ [3,3] ∩ [4,+∞] = [2,+∞], which is the range of length
### of phrase. This have to be satisfied if you need ibus-sdim to build up
### your own inputed phrase via your daily using.
RULES = ce2:p11+p12+p21+p22;ce3:p11+p21+p22+p31;ca4:p11+p21+p31+p41

### Begin Table data.
### Format of every line whose formated in "input_keys\tphrase\tfreq\n" is an
### entry.
### From left to right, the 1st column are the input key combination that you
### entered via keyboard; the 2nd column are presented character or phrase of
### the key combination you want; the 3rd column are frequency of the character
### or phrase.
BEGIN_TABLE

END_TABlE

### Since some input methods use different table for every character to make
### phrase, such as ZhengMa, they need explict define the goucima (the
### phrase-building code for the given character), the format of every entry is
### "character\tgoucima\n". 
### For the input method which just use the full code as word-building code
### just skip this field. The ibus-sdim will build the codes needed from
### above TABLE.
### if you don't need different word-building code, please comment out the
### next few lines with ###, just like these lines you are look at now.
