Haskell Mode
************

Haskell Mode is an Haskell development Environment for GNU Emacs version
24 or later.  It provides syntax-based indentation, font locking,
editing cabal files, and supports running an inferior Haskell
interpreter (e.g.  GHCi).

1 Introduction
**************

"Haskell Mode" is a major mode providing a convenient environment for
editing Haskell (http://www.haskell.org) programs.

   Some of its major features are:

   • Syntax highlighting (font lock),
   • automatic indentation,
   • on-the-fly documentation,
   • interaction with inferior GHCi/Hugs instance, and
   • scanning declarations and placing them in a menu.

1.1 Naming
==========

The name haskell-mode refers to the whole collection of modules in this
package.  There is specifically a file ‘haskell-mode.el‘ which defines a
major mode called ‘haskell-mode‘.  Generally, in this documentation they
will be distinguished by normal font (haskell-mode) and code font
(‘haskell-mode‘).

1.2 History
===========

‘haskell-mode’ has a long history.  It goes all the way back to 1992.
Since then, it has received many contributions in many forms.  Some
design choices that remain in haskell-mode today are historical.  Some
modules are outdated or no longer used, or are used by a few people.

   Historically there hasn’t been a single individual or set of
individuals directing the package’s architecture for a long period of
time, rather, patches and new modules were accepted in liberally and we
are left with a box full of interesting toys that may or may not work.

   As of 2016 Haskell Mode is coordinated using Github at
<https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode>.


File: haskell-mode.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Editing Haskell Code,  Prev: Introduction,  Up: Top

2 Installation
**************

Haskell Mode is distributed as a package in MELPA repository
(https://melpa.org).  To use MELPA as Emacs package archive do the
following:

  1. Customize ‘package-archives’ using ‘M-x’ ‘customize-option’ ‘RET’
     ‘package-archives’ ‘RET’.
  2. Use ‘INS’ to add new archive, use ‘Archive name: melpa-stable’ and
     ‘URL or directory name: http://stable.melpa.org/packages/’.
  3. Fetch new packages using ‘M-x’ ‘package-refresh-contents’.
  4. Install ‘haskell-mode’ using ‘M-x’ ‘package-install’ ‘RET’
     ‘haskell-mode’ ‘RET’.

   Voila!  ‘haskell-mode’ is installed!  You should be able to edit
Haskell source code in color now.

   The above steps should result in the following snippet in your
‘.emacs’:

     (require 'package)
     (custom-set-variables
      ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
      ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
      ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
      ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
      '(package-archives
        (quote
         (("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
          ("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/")))))

2.1 Installation - more information
===================================

‘haskell-mode’ supports GNU Emacs versions 24 and upcoming 25
(snapshot).

   ‘haskell-mode’ is available from melpa-stable (releases)
(http://stable.melpa.org) and melpa (git snapshots) (http://melpa.org).

   Other means of obtaining ‘haskell-mode’ include el-get
(https://github.com/dimitri/el-get), Emacs Prelude
(https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) and Debian package
(https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=haskell-mode).

   Last version of ‘haskell-mode’ that supported Emacs 23 is
‘haskell-mode’ 13.18 available at
<https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode/releases/tag/v13.18>.

2.2 Customizing
===============

Most of ‘haskell-mode’’s settings are configurable via customizable
variables (*note (emacs)Easy Customization::, for details).  You can use

   ‘M-x customize-group <RET> haskell’ to browse the ‘haskell’
customization sub-tree.

   One of the important setting you should customize is the
‘haskell-mode-hook’ variable (*note (emacs)Hooks::) which gets run right
after the ‘haskell-mode’ major mode is initialized for a buffer.  You
can customize ‘haskell-mode-hook’ by ‘M-x customize-variable <RET>
haskell-mode-hook’.

3 Editing Haskell Code
**********************

"Haskell Mode" is actually a collection of so-called major modes(1) one
of which is called ‘haskell-mode’.  To avoid confusion, when referring
to this package the name “Haskell mode” is written in a normal font,
whereas when referring the major mode of the same name ‘haskell-mode’
written with a dash in-between in a typewriter font is used.

   As one might guess, ‘haskell-mode’ is the (programming language(2))
major mode for editing (non-literate) Haskell source code.
‘haskell-mode’ is associated with the file extensions listed below by
default(3).

‘.hs’
     official file extension for (non-literate) Haskell 98/2010 files
‘.hsc’
     “almost-Haskell” input file for the hsc2hs
     (http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/hsc2hs.html)
     pre-processor
‘.cpphs’
     input file for the cpphs (http://projects.haskell.org/cpphs/)
     pre-processor

The major mode ‘literate-haskell-mode’ (which is derived from
‘haskell-mode’ and thus transitively from ‘prog-mode’) provides support
for literate Haskell programs
(http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Literate_programming) and is
associated with the ‘.lhs’ file extension by default.

   ‘literate-haskell-mode’ supports Bird-style as well as TeX-style
literate Haskell files.  The currently detected literate Haskell variant
is shown in the mode line (*note (emacs)Mode Line::) as either
‘LitHaskell/bird’ or ‘LitHaskell/tex’.

3.1 Managing imports
====================

There are a few functions for managing imports.

3.1.1 Jump to imports
---------------------

To jump to your import list, run

   ‘M-x’ ‘haskell-navigate-imports’

   It’s nicer to have a keybinding to do this, for example:

     (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "<f8>") 'haskell-navigate-imports)

   You can hit it repeatedly to jump between groups of imports.  It will
cycle.

3.1.2 Format imports
--------------------

To generally format (sort, align) your imports, you can run

   ‘M-x’ ‘haskell-mode-format-imports’

   Or ‘C-c C-.’.

3.1.3 Sort imports
------------------

To just sort imports, jump to an import section and run

   ‘M-x’ ‘haskell-sort-imports’

3.1.4 Align imports
-------------------

To just align imports, jump to an import section and run

   ‘M-x’ ‘haskell-align-imports’

3.1.5 stylish-haskell
---------------------

As an alternative to the elisp functions described above, haskell-mode
can use the program stylish-haskell
(http://hackage.haskell.org/package/stylish-haskell) to format imports.
You can set this behavior by typing: ‘M-x’ ‘customize-variable’ ‘RET’
‘haskell-stylish-on-save’.  You can install ‘stylish-haskell’ by running
‘stack install stylish-haskell’, or if you have not installed ‘stack’,
‘cabal install stylish-haskell’.

3.2 Haskell Tags
================

‘haskell-mode’ can generate tags when saving source files.  To generate
tags ‘haskell-mode’ uses external program — Hasktags
(https://github.com/MarcWeber/hasktags) (wiki-article
(https://wiki.haskell.org/Tags)).  To turn on tags generatation
customize or set to ‘t’ ‘haskell-tags-on-save’ variable.  Also, you may
find useful to revert tags tables automatically, this can be done by
customizing ‘tags-revert-without-query’ variable (either globally or for
Haskell buffers only).

3.3 Profiling and Debugging support
===================================

When profiling code with GHC, it is often useful to add cost centres
(https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html#cost-centres)
by hand.  These allow finer-grained information about program behavior.
‘haskell-mode’ provides the function ‘haskell-mode-toggle-scc-at-point’
to make this more convenient.  It will remove an SCC annotation at point
if one is present, or add one if point is over whitespace.  By default
it is bound to ‘C-c C-s’.

4 Font Lock Support
*******************

‘haskell-mode’ supports "syntax highlighting" via Emacs’ Font Lock minor
mode which should be enabled by default in current Emacsen.  *Note
(emacs)Font Lock::, for more information on how to control
‘font-lock-mode’.

   Syntax highlighting facilities parse strings and string escape
sequences and are able to highlight unrecognized constructs.

   Haskell Mode shows keywords, identifiers, operators, constructors and
types in different colors.

   There is also support to use mode-specific syntax highlighing for
quasiquotes.  Customize ‘haskell-font-lock-quasi-quote-modes’ to make
sure your quoters are supported.


File: haskell-mode.info,  Node: Completion support,  Next: Unicode support,  Prev: Font Lock Support,  Up: Top

5 Completion support
********************

‘haskell-mode’ can complete symbols, pragma directives, language
extensions, and language keywords out-of-box.  ‘haskell-mode’ completes
identifiers (symbols) using tags (see “Tags”), however you can get more
precise completions with ‘haskell-interactive-mode’.  In interactive
mode completion candidates are produced by querying GHCi REPL.

   If ‘haskell-interactive-mode’ is enabled and working Haskell mode
provides completions for import statements taking into account currently
loaded and available packages.  Also it completes symbols querying REPL
with ‘:complete’ command, hence completion candidate list also includes
symbols from imported modules.

   Unfortunatelly, it is not possible to provide candidates for
identifiers defined locally in ‘let’ and ‘where’ blocks even in
interactive mode.  But if you’re using company-mode
(http://company-mode.github.io/) you can override ‘company-backends’
variable for Haskell buffers to combine completion candidates from
completion-at-point function (‘company-capf’ backend) and dynamic
abbrevs.  ‘company-mode’ provides special backend for dabbrev code
completions, namely ‘company-dabbrev-code’.  To combine completions from
diffrent backends you can create grouped backends, it is very easy — a
grouped backend is just a list of backends, for example:

     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (set (make-local-variable 'company-backends)
                      (append '((company-capf company-dabbrev-code))
                              company-backends))))

6 Unicode support
*****************

See the Haskell Wiki’s entry on Unicode Symbols
(http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Unicode-symbols) for general
information about Unicode support in Haskell.

   As Emacs supports editing files containing Unicode out of the box, so
does Haskell Mode.  As an add-on, Haskell Mode includes the
‘haskell-unicode’ input method which allows you to easily type a number
of Unicode symbols that are useful when writing Haskell code; *Note
(emacs)Input Methods::, for more details.

   To automatically enable the ‘haskell-unicode’ input method in
haskell-mode buffers use ‘M-x customize-variable <RET>
haskell-mode-hook’ or put the following code in your ‘.emacs’ file:

     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-unicode-input-method)

To temporarily enable this input method for a single buffer you can use
‘M-x turn-on-haskell-unicode-input-method’.

   When the ‘haskell-unicode’ input method is active, you can simply
type ‘->’ and it is immediately replaced with ‘→’.  Use ‘C-\’ to toggle
the input method.  To see a table of all key sequences use ‘M-x
describe-input-method <RET> haskell-unicode’.  A sequence like ‘<=’ is
ambiguous and can mean either ‘⇐’ or ‘≤’.  Typing it presents you with a
choice.  Type ‘1’ or ‘2’ to select an option or keep typing to use the
default option.

   If you don’t like the highlighting of partially matching tokens you
can turn it off by setting ‘input-method-highlight-flag’ to ‘nil’ via
‘M-x customize-variable’.


File: haskell-mode.info,  Node: Indentation,  Next: External indentation,  Prev: Unicode support,  Up: Top

7 Indentation
*************

In Haskell, code indentation has semantic meaning as it defines the
block structure.  Haskell also supports braces and semicolons notation
for conveying the block structure.  However, most Haskell programs
written by humans use indentation for block structuring.

   Haskell Mode ships with two indentation modes:

   • ‘haskell-indentation-mode’ (default).

     This is a semi-intelligent indentation mode doing a decent job at
     recognizing Haskell syntactical constructs.  It is based on a
     recursive descent Haskell parser.  ‘TAB’ selects the next potential
     indentation position, ‘S-TAB’ selects the previous one.  If a block
     is selected you can use ‘TAB’ to indent the block more and ‘S-TAB’
     to indent the block less.

   • ‘haskell-indent-mode’ (optional).

     This is a semi-intelligent indentation mode doing a decent job at
     recognizing Haskell syntactical constructs.  It is based on a
     decision table.  Sadly it is no longer developed and does not
     recognize newer Haskell syntax.  ‘TAB’ cycles through all available
     indentation positions.

     To use ‘haskell-indent-mode’, add this to your ‘~/.emacs’ file:

          (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-indent)

     Note that ‘turn-on-haskell-indent’ will disable
     ‘haskell-indentation-mode’.

   For general information about indentation support in GNU Emacs, *note
(emacs)Indentation::.

7.1 Rectangle Commands
======================

GNU Emacs provides so-called "rectangle commands" which operate on
rectangular areas of text, which are particularly useful for languages
with a layout rule such as Haskell.  *Note (emacs)Rectangles::, to learn
more about rectangle commands.

   Moreover, CUA mode (*note (emacs)CUA Bindings::) provides enhanced
rectangle support with visible rectangle highlighting.  When CUA mode is
active, you can initiate a rectangle selection by ‘C-RET’ and extend it
simply by movement commands.  You don’t have to enable full CUA mode to
benefit from these enhanced rectangle commands; you can activate CUA
selection mode (without redefining ‘C-x’,‘C-c’,‘C-v’, and ‘C-z’) by
calling ‘M-x cua-selection-mode’ (or adding ‘(cua-selection-mode nil)’
to your ‘haskell-mode-hook’).

7.2 Region indent is a no-op
============================

There is a ‘indent-region’ function that supposedly could be used to
indent code region without changing its semantics.  Sadly it does not
work that way because usual use case for ‘indent-region’ is:

  1. Alter first line of code in region.
  2. Call ‘indent-region’ to fix indentation for remaining lines.

   Note that between 1 and 2 program is already semantically broken and
knowing how to indent it preserving semantic from before step 1 would
require time travel.

   To stay on the safe side ‘indent-region-function’ is bound to a no-op
in ‘haskell-mode’.

8 Other ways to indent code
***************************

8.1 Indentation with tabs, not spaces
=====================================

Some projects require indenting code with tabs and forbid indenting it
with spaces.  For hacking on such projects, check out
haskell-tab-indent-mode
(https://spwhitton.name/tech/code/haskell-tab-indent).

8.2 Structured indentation
==========================

Another alternative is to install structured-haskell-mode
(https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode).  which indents
code by parsing the code with a full Haskell parser and deciding where
to indent based on that.


File: haskell-mode.info,  Node: Autoformating,  Next: Module templates,  Prev: External indentation,  Up: Top

9 Using external formatters
***************************

You can enable stylish-haskell
(https://github.com/jaspervdj/stylish-haskell) by installing it:

     $ cabal install stylish-haskell

   And by enabling it with a customization

     (custom-set-variables
      '(haskell-stylish-on-save t))

   Now when you run ‘save-buffer’ (or ‘C-x C-s’) the module will be
automatically formatted.

   Alternatively, you can run the function directly on demand with ‘M-x’
‘haskell-mode-stylish-buffer’.


File: haskell-mode.info,  Node: Module templates,  Next: Declaration scanning,  Prev: Autoformating,  Up: Top

10 Module templates
*******************

To enable auto-insertion of module templates, enable:

     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'haskell-auto-insert-module-template)

   When you open a file called ‘Foo.hs’, it will auto-insert

     -- |

     module Foo where

   And put your cursor in the comment section.


File: haskell-mode.info,  Node: Declaration scanning,  Next: Compilation,  Prev: Module templates,  Up: Top

11 Declaration scannning
************************

‘haskell-decl-scan-mode’ is a minor mode which performs declaration
scanning and provides ‘M-x imenu’ support (*note (emacs)Imenu:: for more
information).

   For non-literate and TeX-style literate scripts, the common
convention that top-level declarations start at the first column is
assumed.  For Bird-style literate scripts, the common convention that
top-level declarations start at the third column, ie.  after ‘> ’, is
assumed.

   When ‘haskell-decl-scan-mode’ is active, the standard Emacs top-level
definition movement commands (*note (emacs)Moving by Defuns::) are
enabled to operate on Haskell declarations:

‘C-M-a’
     Move to beginning of current or preceding declaration
     (‘beginning-of-defun’).

‘C-M-e’
     Move to end of current or following declaration (‘end-of-defun’).

‘C-M-h’
     Select whole current or following declaration (‘mark-defun’).

   Moreover, if enabled via the option
‘haskell-decl-scan-add-to-menubar’, a menu item “Declarations” is added
to the menu bar listing the scanned declarations and allowing to jump to
declarations in the source buffer.

   It’s recommended to have font lock mode enabled (*note (emacs)Font
Lock::) as ‘haskell-decl-scan-mode’ ignores text highlighted with
‘font-lock-comment-face’.

   As usual, in order to activate ‘haskell-decl-scan-mode’ automatically
for Haskell buffers, add ‘haskell-decl-scan-mode’ to
‘haskell-mode-hook’:

     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'haskell-decl-scan-mode)

   ‘haskell-decl-scan-mode’ enables the use of features that build upon
‘imenu’ support such as Speedbar Frames (*note (emacs)Speedbar::) or the
global “Which Function” minor mode (*note (emacs)Which Function::).

   In order to enable ‘which-function-mode’ for Haskell buffers you need
to add the following to your Emacs initialization:

     (eval-after-load "which-func"
       '(add-to-list 'which-func-modes 'haskell-mode))

11.1 Speedbar
=============

Haskell-mode comes with declaration scanning support.  This means that
if you enable Haskell support for speedbar:

     (speedbar-add-supported-extension ".hs")

   And open speedbar with

   ‘M-x speedbar’

   It gives a listing of each module and under each module:

         Imports
         Instances
         Data types
         Classes
         Bindings

   You will get a bar that looks like this:

~/Projects/ace/src/ACE/
0:<+> Types
0:[+] Combinators.hs
0:[-] Datalog.hs
1:   {-} Classes
2:      > ToTerm

0:[-] Parsers.hs
1:   {+} Imports
1:   {-} Datatypes
2:      > ACEParser
0:[+] Pretty.hs
0:[+] Tokenizer.hs

   The hierarchy is expandable/collapsible and each entry will jump to
the line in the right file when clicked/selected.

12 Compilation
**************

Haskell mode comes equipped with a specialized "Compilation mode"
tailored to GHC’s compiler messages with optional support for Cabal
projects.  *Note (emacs)Compilation Mode::, for more information about
the basic commands provided by the Compilation mode which are available
in the Haskell compilation sub-mode as well.  The additional features
provided compared to Emacs’ basic Compilation mode are:

   • DWIM-style auto-detection of compile command (including support for
     CABAL projects)
   • Support for GHC’s compile messages and recognizing error, warning
     and info source locations (including ‘-ferror-spans’ syntax)
   • Support for filtering out GHC’s uninteresting ‘Loading package...’
     linker messages

   In order to use it, invoke the ‘haskell-compile’ command instead of
‘compile’ as you would for the ordinary Compilation mode.  It’s
recommended to bind ‘haskell-compile’ to a convenient key binding.  For
instance, you can add the following to your Emacs initialization to bind
‘haskell-compile’ to ‘C-c C-c’.

     (eval-after-load "haskell-mode"
         '(define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'haskell-compile))

     (eval-after-load "haskell-cabal"
         '(define-key haskell-cabal-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'haskell-compile))

The following description assumes that ‘haskell-compile’ has been bound
to ‘C-c C-c’.

   When invoked, ‘haskell-compile’ tries to guess how to compile the
Haskell program your currently visited buffer belongs to, by searching
for a ‘.cabal’ file in the current of enclosing parent folders.  If a
‘.cabal’ file was found, the command defined in the
‘haskell-compile-cabal-build-command’ option is used.  Note that to
compile a ‘stack’ based project you will need to set this variable to
‘stack build’.  As usual you can do it using ‘M-x customize-variable’ or
with:

     (setq haskell-compile-cabal-build-command "stack build")

   Moreover, when requesting to compile a ‘.cabal’-file is detected and
a negative prefix argument (e.g.  ‘C-- C-c C-c’) was given, the
alternative ‘haskell-compile-cabal-build-command-alt’ is invoked.  By
default, ‘haskell-compile-cabal-build-command-alt’ contains a ‘cabal
clean -s’ command in order to force a full rebuild.

   Otherwise if no ‘.cabal’ could be found, a single-module compilation
is assumed and ‘haskell-compile-command’ is used (_if_ the currently
visited buffer contains Haskell source code).

   You can also inspect and modify the compile command to be invoked
temporarily by invoking ‘haskell-compile’ with a prefix argument (e.g.
‘C-u C-c C-c’).  If later-on you want to recompile using the same
customized compile command, invoke ‘recompile’ (bound to ‘g’) inside the
‘*haskell-compilation*’ buffer.

13 Inferior Haskell interpreter
*******************************

The major mode ‘inferior-haskell-mode’ provides support for interacting
with an inferior Haskell process based on ‘comint-mode’.

   By default the ‘haskell-mode-map’ keymap is setup to use this mode:

‘C-c C-z’
     is bound to ‘switch-to-haskell’
‘C-c C-b’
     is bound to ‘switch-to-haskell’
‘C-c C-l’
     is bound to ‘inferior-haskell-load-file’
‘C-c C-t’
     is bound to ‘inferior-haskell-type’
‘C-c C-i’
     is bound to ‘inferior-haskell-info’

   The Haskell interpreter used by the inferior Haskell mode is
auto-detected by default, but is customizable via the
‘haskell-program-name’ variable.

   Currently, GHCi and Hugs are support as Haskell interpreter.

   TODO/WRITEME


File: haskell-mode.info,  Node: Interactive Haskell,  Next: Editing Cabal files,  Prev: Inferior Haskell interpreter,  Up: Top

14 Interactive Haskell
**********************

An alternative mode providing a REPL (read–eval–print loop) via GHCi
sessions is called ‘haskell-interactive-mode’, which effectively
replaces ‘inferior-haskell-mode’, but comes with a different set of
features:

   • Separate sessions per Cabal project ‘haskell-session.el’.
   • A new inferior Haskell process handling code ‘haskell-process.el’.
   • New REPL implementation similiar to SLIME/IELM
   • Navigatable error overlays ‘haskell-interactive-mode.el’.

   In order to use ‘haskell-interactive-mode’ instead of the default
‘inferior-haskell-mode’, you need to replace some of the default
keybindings in the ‘haskell-mode-map’ keymap with the respective
‘haskell-interactive-mode’ counterparts:

     (eval-after-load "haskell-mode"
       '(progn
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-x C-d") nil)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-z") 'haskell-interactive-switch)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-l") 'haskell-process-load-file)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-b") 'haskell-interactive-switch)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-t") 'haskell-process-do-type)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-i") 'haskell-process-do-info)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c M-.") nil)
         (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-d") nil)))

   With ‘haskell-interactive-mode’, each Haskell source buffer is
associated with at most one GHCi session, so when you call
‘haskell-process-load-file’ for a Haskell source buffer which has no
session associated yet, you’re asked which GHCi session to create or
associate with.

14.1 Goto Error
===============

In a Haskell source buffer associated with a GHCi session, errors that
prevent the file from loading are highlighted with ‘haskell-error-face’.
You can move between these error lines with

‘M-n’
     is bound to ‘haskell-goto-next-error’
‘M-p’
     is bound to ‘haskell-goto-prev-error’
‘C-c M-p’
     is bound to ‘haskell-goto-first-error’

14.2 Using GHCi-ng
==================

Put ‘:set +c’ in your ‘.ghci’ or run it in the REPL. Then use these
keybindings:

     (define-key interactive-haskell-mode-map (kbd "M-.") 'haskell-mode-goto-loc)
     (define-key interactive-haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-t") 'haskell-mode-show-type-at)

   You have to load the module before it works, after that it will
remember for the current GHCi session.

14.3 Customizing
================

What kind of Haskell REPL ‘haskell-interactive-mode’ will start up
depends on the value of ‘haskell-process-type’.  This can be one of the
symbols ‘auto’, ‘ghci’, ‘cabal-repl’, or ‘stack-ghci’.  If it’s ‘auto’,
the directory contents and available programs will be used to make a
best guess at the process type.  The actual process type will then
determine which variables ‘haskell-interactive-mode’ will access to
determine the program to start and its arguments:

   • If it’s ‘ghci’, ‘haskell-process-path-ghci’ and
     ‘haskell-process-args-ghci’ will be used.
   • If it’s ‘cabal-repl’, ‘haskell-process-path-ghci’ and
     ‘haskell-process-args-ghci’.
   • If it’s ‘stack-ghci’, ‘haskell-process-path-stack’ and
     ‘haskell-process-args-stack-ghci’ will be used.

   With each of these pairs, the the ‘haskell-process-path-...’ variable
needs to be a string specifying the program path, or a list of strings
where the first element is the program path and the rest are initial
arguments.  The ‘haskell-process-args-...’ is a list of strings
specifying (further) command-line arguments.

14.4 Haskell Interactive Mode Setup
===================================

The most straight-forward way to get setup with Interactive Mode is to
bind the right keybindings and set some customizations.  This page
contains a good base setup.

   To enable the minor mode which activates keybindings associated with
interactive mode, use:

     (require 'haskell-interactive-mode)
     (require 'haskell-process)
     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'interactive-haskell-mode)

14.4.1 Customizations
---------------------

This enables some handy and benign features.

     (custom-set-variables
       '(haskell-process-suggest-remove-import-lines t)
       '(haskell-process-auto-import-loaded-modules t)
       '(haskell-process-log t))

14.4.2 Haskell-mode bindings
----------------------------

This gives the basic ways to start a session.  In a Haskell buffer:

   • Run ‘C-`’ to make a REPL open, this will create a session, start
     GHCi, and open the REPL.
   • Or: run ‘C-c C-l’ to load the file.  This will first try to start a
     session as the previous command does.
   • Or: run any command which requires a running session.  It will
     always prompt to create one if there isn’t one already for the
     current project.

     (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-l") 'haskell-process-load-or-reload)
     (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-`") 'haskell-interactive-bring)
     (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-t") 'haskell-process-do-type)
     (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-i") 'haskell-process-do-info)
     (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'haskell-process-cabal-build)
     (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-k") 'haskell-interactive-mode-clear)
     (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") 'haskell-process-cabal)

14.4.3 Cabal-mode bindings
--------------------------

The below commands pretty much match the ones above, but are handy to
have in cabal-mode, too:

     (define-key haskell-cabal-mode-map (kbd "C-`") 'haskell-interactive-bring)
     (define-key haskell-cabal-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-k") 'haskell-interactive-mode-clear)
     (define-key haskell-cabal-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'haskell-process-cabal-build)
     (define-key haskell-cabal-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") 'haskell-process-cabal)

14.4.4 GHCi process type
------------------------

By default ‘haskell-process-type’ is set to ‘auto’.  It is smart enough
to pick the right type based on your project structure and installed
tools, but in case something goes funky or you want to explicitly set
the process type and ignore the inferred type, you can customize this
setting by running ‘M-x’ ‘customize-variable’ ‘RET’
‘haskell-process-type’ ‘RET’, or by setting the code:

     (custom-set-variables
       '(haskell-process-type 'cabal-repl))

   Here is a list of available process types:

   • ghci
   • cabal-repl
   • cabal-dev
   • cabal-ghci
   • stack-ghci

   Please, check the documentation for ‘haskell-process-type’ to see how
the real type is guessed, when it’s set to ‘auto’.

14.4.5 Troubleshooting
----------------------

Launching your GHCi process can fail when you’re first getting setup,
depending on the type you choose.  If it does fail to launch, switch to
the buffer ‘*haskell-process-log*’ and see what’s up.  The buffer
contains a log of incoming/outgoing messages to the GHCi process.

14.5 Haskell Interactive Mode Tags Using GHCi
=============================================

You can bind the following to use GHCi to find definitions of things:

     (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "M-.") 'haskell-mode-jump-to-def)

   The one problem with this approach is that if your code doesn’t
compile, GHCi doesn’t give any location info.  So you need to make sure
your code compiles and the modules you want to jump to are loaded
byte-compiled.

   Note: I think that when you restart GHCi you lose location
information, even if you have the ‘.o’ and ‘.hi’ files lying around.
I’m not sure.  But sometimes ‘:i foo’ will give ‘foo is defined in Bar’
rather than ‘foo is defined in /foo/Bar.hs:123:23’.

   Alternatively, you can use tags generation, which doesn’t require a
valid compile.

14.5.1 Tags Setup
-----------------

Make sure to install ‘hasktags’.

         $ cabal install hasktags

   Then add the customization variable to enable tags generation on
save:

     (custom-set-variables
       '(haskell-tags-on-save t))

   And make sure ‘hasktags’ is in your ‘$PATH’ which Emacs can see.

14.5.2 Generating tags
----------------------

Now, every time you run ‘save-buffer’ (‘C-x C-s’), there is a hook that
will run and generate Emacs *Note (emacs)Tags::.  for the whole project
directory.  The resulting file will be called ‘TAGS’.

   WARNING: You should be careful that your project root isn’t your home
directory or something, otherwise it will traverse all the way down and
take an impossibly long time.

14.5.3 Jumping to tags
----------------------

Bind the following keybinding:

     (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "M-.") 'haskell-mode-tag-find)

   To jump to the location of the top-level identifier at point, run
‘M-x’ ‘haskell-mode-tag-find’ or ‘M-.’.

14.5.4 Hybrid: GHCi and fallback to tags
----------------------------------------

To use GHCi first and then if that fails to fallback to tags for
jumping, use:

     (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "M-.") 'haskell-mode-jump-to-def-or-tag)

14.5.5 Troubleshooting tags
---------------------------

Sometimes a ‘TAGS’ file is deleted (by you or some other process).
Emacs will complain that it doesn’t exist anymore.  To resolve this
simply do ‘M-x’ ‘tags-reset-tags-tables’.

14.6 Sessions
=============

All commands in Haskell Interactive Mode work within a session.
Consider it like a “project” or a “solution” in popular IDEs.  It tracks
the root of your project and an associated process and REPL.

14.6.1 Start a session
----------------------

To start a session run the following steps:

   • Open some Cabal or Haskell file.
   • Run ‘C-`’ to make a REPL open, this will create a session, start
     GHCi, and open the REPL.
   • Or: run ‘C-c C-l’ to load the file.  This will first try to start a
     session as the previous command does.
   • Or: run any command which requires a running session.  It will
     always prompt to create one if there isn’t one already for the
     current project.

   It will prompt for a Cabal directory and a current directory.  It
figures out where the cabal directory is and defaults for the current
directory, so you should be able to just hit RET twice.

14.6.2 Switch a session
-----------------------

Sometimes a particular file is used in two different sessions/projects.
You can run

         M-x haskell-session-change

   If it prompts you to make a new session, tell it no (that’s a bug).
It will ask you to choose from a list of sessions.

14.6.3 Killing a session
------------------------

To kill a session you can run

         M-x haskell-session-kill

   Which will prompt to kill all associated buffers, too.  Hit ‘n‘ to
retain them.

   Alternatively, you can switch to the REPL and just kill the buffer
normally with ‘C-x k RET’.  It will prompt

         Kill the whole session (y or n)?

   You can choose ‘y’ to kill the session itself, or ‘n’ to just kill
the REPL buffer.  You can bring it back with ‘M-x’
‘haskell-interactive-bring’.

14.6.4 Menu
-----------

To see a list of all sessions you have open with some simple statistics
about memory usage, etc.  run

         M-x haskell-menu

   For example:

         foo  14648 08:21:42 214MB /path/to/fpco/foo/  /path/to/fpco/foo/ ghci
         bar  29119 00:22:03 130MB /path/to/bar/       /path/to/bar/      ghci
         mu   22575 08:48:20 73MB  /path/to/fpco/mu/   /path/to/fpco/mu/  ghci

14.7 Compiling
==============

There are a bunch of ways to compile Haskell modules.  This page covers
a few of them.

14.7.1 Load into GHCi
---------------------

To compile and load a Haskell module into GHCi, run the following

         M-x haskell-process-load

   Or ‘C-c C-l’.  You’ll see any compile errors in the REPL window.

14.7.2 Build the Cabal project
------------------------------

To compile the whole Cabal project, run the following

         M-x haskell-process-cabal-build

   Or ‘C-c C-c’.  You’ll see any compile errors in the REPL window.

14.7.3 Reloading modules
------------------------

To reload the current module, even when you’re in other modules, you can
run ‘C-u M-x’ ‘haskell-process-load-or-reload’ or ‘C-u C-c C-l’.  It
will now reload that module whenever you run ‘C-c C-l’ in the future
from whatever module you’re in.  To disable this mode, just run ‘C-u C-c
C-l’ again.

14.7.4 Jumping to compile errors
--------------------------------

You can use the standard compile error navigation function ‘C-x `’ —
jump to the next error.

   Or you can move your cursor to an error in the REPL and hit ‘RET’ to
jump to it.

14.7.5 Auto-removing imports
----------------------------

If the customization variable
‘haskell-process-suggest-remove-import-lines’ is enabled.

     (custom-set-variables
       '(haskell-process-suggest-remove-import-lines t))

   Building and loading modules which output warnings like,

         Warning: The import of `Control.Monad' is redundant
           except perhaps to import instances from `Control.Monad'
         To import instances alone, use: import Control.Monad()

   will prompt the user with

     > The import line `Control.Monad' is redundant. Remove? (y, n, c: comment out)

   If you answer

   • ‘y’: it will delete the import, but leave the empty line remaining
     (this avoids messing with line positions in subsequent error
     messages).
   • ‘n’: it will leave the import.
   • ‘c’: it will comment out the import (this is handy for when you
     just want to temporarily hide an import).

14.7.6 Auto-adding of modules to import
---------------------------------------

Enable the customization variable
‘haskell-process-suggest-hoogle-imports’.

     (custom-set-variables
       '(haskell-process-suggest-hoogle-imports t))

   Whenever GHC says something is not in scope, it will hoogle that
symbol.  If there are results, it will prompt to add one of the modules
from Hoogle’s results.

   You need to make sure you’ve generated your Hoogle database properly.

14.7.7 Auto-adding of extensions
--------------------------------

It you use an extension which is not enabled, GHC will often inform you.
For example, if you write:

     newtype X a = X (IO a)
       deriving (Monad)

   Then you’ll see a message like:

         x.hs:13:13: Can't make a derived instance of `Monad X': …
               `Monad' is not a derivable class
               Try -XGeneralizedNewtypeDeriving for GHC's newtype-deriving extension
             In the newtype declaration for `X'

   This ‘-XFoo’ pattern will be picked up and you will be prompted:

     > Add `{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}` to the top of the
     > file? (y or n)

   If you answer ‘y‘, it will temporarily jump to the buffer and it to
the top of the file.

14.7.8 Orphan instances
-----------------------

If GHC complains about orphan instances, you usually are doing it
intentionally, so it prompts to add ‘-fno-warn-orphans’ to the top of
the file with an ‘OPTIONS’ pragma.

14.7.9 Auto-adding of dependencies
----------------------------------

When doing a build, you will sometimes get a message from GHC like:

         src/ACE/Tokenizer.hs:11:18: Could not find module `Data.Attoparsec.Text' …
             It is a member of the hidden package `attoparsec-0.11.1.0'.

   This message contains all the necessary information to add this to
your .cabal file, so you will be prompted to add it to your .cabal file:

         Add `attoparsec' to ace.cabal? (y or n)  y

   If you hit ‘y’, it will prompt with this:

         attoparsec >= 0.11.1.0

   Which you can edit (e.g.  do some PVP decision or remove constraints
entirely), and then it will open up your ‘.cabal’ file and go through
each section:

         Add to library? (y or n)  y

   This will add it to the top of the ‘build-depends’ field in your
library section.  If you have any executables, it will go through each
of those, prompting, too.

   Now you can rebuild with ‘C-c C-c’ again.

14.8 Haskell Interactive Mode REPL
==================================

When GHCi has been launched, it works on a read-eval-print basis.  So
you will be presented with the prompt:

         The lambdas must flow.
         Changed directory: /path/to/your/project/
         λ>

14.8.1 Changing REPL target
---------------------------

With ‘haskell-session-change-target’ you can change the target for REPL
session.

   After REPL session started, in ‘haskell-interactive-mode’ buffer
invoke the ‘haskell-session-change-target’ and select from available
targets for

   - Testing

   - Benchmark

   - Executable

   - Library

   Answer “yes” to restart the session and run your tests, benchmarks,
executables.

   TODO/WRITEME

14.8.2 Bringing the REPL
------------------------

If you don’t know where the REPL buffer is, you can always bring it
with:

         M-x haskell-interactive-bring

   Or ‘C-`’.

14.8.3 Evaluating expressions
-----------------------------

To evaluate expressions, simply type one out and hit ‘RET‘.

         λ> 123
         123

14.8.4 Type of expressions
--------------------------

You can use normal ‘:type’ which is part of GHCi to get the type of
something:

         λ> :t id
         id :: a -> a

   But you can also just write out the value directly,

         λ> id
         id :: a -> a

   and because there’s no ‘Show’ instance for ‘(a -> a)’.  This would
normally yield a compile error:

         No instance for (Show (a0 -> a0))
           arising from a use of `print'
         Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Show (a0 -> a0))
         In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it

   It will run ‘:type id’ in the background and print out the result.
The same is true for ambiguous things:

         λ> :t read "a"
         read "a" :: Read a => a

   Because this would normally be an ambiguous constraint:

         Ambiguous type variable `a0' in the constraint:
           (Read a0) arising from a use of `read'
         Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
         In the expression: read \"a\"
         In an equation for `it': it = read \"a\"

   Which is less useful than just printing the type out.

   You can disable this behaviour by disabling the customization option:

     (custom-set-variables
       '(haskell-interactive-types-for-show-ambiguous nil))

14.8.5 Printing mode
--------------------

You can choose between printing modes used for the results of evaluating
expressions.  To do that, configure the variable
‘haskell-interactive-mode-eval-mode’.  Example:

     (setq haskell-interactive-mode-eval-mode 'haskell-mode)

   A handy function you can use is:

     (defun haskell-interactive-toggle-print-mode ()
       (interactive)
       (setq haskell-interactive-mode-eval-mode
             (intern
              (ido-completing-read "Eval result mode: "
                                   '("fundamental-mode"
                                     "haskell-mode"
                                     "espresso-mode"
                                     "ghc-core-mode"
                                     "org-mode")))))

   (Add whichever modes you want to use.)

   And then run

         M-x haskell-interactive-toggle-print-mode

   Or ‘C-c C-v’:

     (define-key haskell-interactive-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-v")
                 'haskell-interactive-toggle-print-mode)

   There you can choose ‘haskell-mode‘, for example, to pretty print the
output as Haskell.

14.8.6 Presentations
--------------------

If you have the ‘present’ package installed, you can use the following
syntax to print anything which is an instance of ‘Data’:

         λ> :present 123
         123

   It will print data structures lazily:

         λ> :present [1..]
         [1
         ,[Integer]]

   It shows types when there is an unevaluated field in a constructor.
You can click the ‘[Integer]’ or press ‘RET’ on it to expand further:

         λ> :present [1..]
         [1
         ,2
         ,[Integer]]

   Etc.  Remember: this only works for instances of ‘Data.Data.Data’.

14.8.7 History
--------------

A history is maintained for the duration of the REPL buffer.  To go up
and down in the history, run ‘M-p’ for previous and ‘M-n’ for next.

14.8.8 Cancelling commands
--------------------------

To cancel a running REPL command, run ‘C-c C-c’.

14.8.9 Clear the REPL
---------------------

Run ‘C-c C-k’ to clear the REPL.

14.8.10 Trick: Put Interactive REPL in Separate Frame
-----------------------------------------------------

The following ‘create-haskell-interactive-frame’ is a quick hack to move
the repl to a separate frame, for those that want a more predictable
layout of windows in Emacs.

     (defun create-unfocused-frame ()
       (let*
         ((prv (window-frame))
          (created (make-frame)))
         (select-frame-set-input-focus prv) created))

     (defun create-haskell-interactive-frame ()
       (interactive)
       (haskell-interactive-bring)
       (create-unfocused-frame)
       (delete-window))


14.8.11 Troubleshooting
-----------------------

If the REPL ever goes funny, you can clear the command queue via:

         M-x haskell-process-clear

   Alternatively, you can just restart the process:

         M-x haskell-process-restart

   You can also switch to the buffer ‘*haskell-process-log*’, which can
be enabled and disabled with the customization variable
‘haskell-process-log‘, to see what the cause of your troubles are.

   If the process fails and nothing unusual is in the process log, the
following command can dump the ‘haskell-process’ state:

         M-: (haskell-process)

   The output can be copied from the ‘*Messages*’ buffer.

14.9 Haskell Interactive Mode Querying
======================================

There a few ways GHCi lets you query information about your code.

14.9.1 Get identifer type
-------------------------

To print the type of the top-level identifier at point in the REPL and
in the message buffer, run the following command:

         M-x haskell-process-do-type

   or ‘C-c C-t’.

14.9.2 Insert identifier’s type as type signature
-------------------------------------------------

To print the type of the top-level identifier at point, run the
following command:

         C-u M-x haskell-process-do-type

   or ‘C-u C-c C-t’.

14.9.3 Get identifier info
--------------------------

To print the info of the identifier at point, run the following command:

         M-x haskell-process-do-info

   or ‘C-c C-i’.

14.9.4 Presentation mode
------------------------

When using ‘C-c C-i’ or ‘C-c C-t’ it will open a buffer in
haskell-presentation-mode.  You can hit ‘q’ to close the buffer.

   But you can also continue to use ‘C-c C-i’ inside the buffer to drill
further down data types and classes.

   E.g.  if you go to ‘Ord’ in your code buffer and ‘C-c C-i’, it will
popup a buffer containing

     class Eq a => Ord a where
       compare :: a -> a -> Ordering
       (<) :: a -> a -> Bool
       (>=) :: a -> a -> Bool
       (>) :: a -> a -> Bool
       (<=) :: a -> a -> Bool
       max :: a -> a -> a
       min :: a -> a -> a
       	-- Defined in `GHC.Classes'

   And all the instances of that class.  But then you can also move your
cursor to ‘Ordering’ and hit ‘C-c C-i’ again to get another popup:

     data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT 	-- Defined in `GHC.Types'
     instance Bounded Ordering -- Defined in `GHC.Enum'
     instance Enum Ordering -- Defined in `GHC.Enum'
     instance Eq Ordering -- Defined in `GHC.Classes'
     instance Ord Ordering -- Defined in `GHC.Classes'
     instance Read Ordering -- Defined in `GHC.Read'
     instance Show Ordering -- Defined in `GHC.Show'

   And so on.  It’s a very good way of exploring a new codebase.

14.9.5 Browse import’s module
-----------------------------

To print all exported identifiers of the module imported by the import
line at point, run the following command:

         M-x haskell-process-do-info

   or ‘C-c C-i’.  It will print all exports by running ‘:browse
The.Module’ in the GHCi process.

14.10 Haskell Interactive Mode Cabal integration
================================================

There’s some integration with Cabal in Haskell Interactive Mode.  Once
you’ve started a session, the features below are available.

14.10.1 Cabal building
----------------------

The most common Cabal action is building, so that has a specific
command:

         M-x haskell-process-cabal-build

   Or ‘C-c C-c’.  When building, it will hide unneccessary output.

   For example, to build the ‘ace‘ package, the output is simply:

         Compiling: ACE.Types.Tokens
         Compiling: ACE.Combinators
         Compiling: ACE.Tokenizer
         Compiling: ACE.Parsers
         Compiling: ACE.Pretty
         Compiling: ACE
         Complete: cabal build (0 compiler messages)

   Whereas the complete output is normally:

         Building ace-0.5...
         Preprocessing library ace-0.5...
         [4 of 9] Compiling ACE.Types.Tokens ( src/ACE/Types/Tokens.hs, dist/build/ACE/Types/Tokens.o )
         [5 of 9] Compiling ACE.Combinators  ( src/ACE/Combinators.hs, dist/build/ACE/Combinators.o ) [ACE.Types.Tokens changed]
         [6 of 9] Compiling ACE.Tokenizer    ( src/ACE/Tokenizer.hs, dist/build/ACE/Tokenizer.o ) [ACE.Types.Tokens changed]
         [7 of 9] Compiling ACE.Parsers      ( src/ACE/Parsers.hs, dist/build/ACE/Parsers.o )
         [8 of 9] Compiling ACE.Pretty       ( src/ACE/Pretty.hs, dist/build/ACE/Pretty.o )
         [9 of 9] Compiling ACE              ( src/ACE.hs, dist/build/ACE.o ) [ACE.Tokenizer changed]
         In-place registering ace-0.5...

   Which is considerably more verbose but rarely useful or interesting.

14.10.2 Arbitrary cabal commands
--------------------------------

To run an arbitrary Cabal command:

         C-u M-x haskell-process-cabal

   Or run ‘C-u C-c c’.

   It will prompt for an input, so you can write ‘configure -fdev’, for
example.

14.10.3 Completing cabal commands
---------------------------------

To run some common Cabal commands, just run:

         M-x haskell-process-cabal

   Or ‘C-c c’.  This is commonly used to do ‘install’, ‘haddock’,
‘configure’, etc.

14.11 Haskell Interactive Mode Debugger
=======================================

There is limited support for debugging in GHCi.  Haskell Interactive
Mode provides an interface for interacting with this.

14.11.1 Opening the debug buffer
--------------------------------

To open the debug buffer run the following command from any buffer
associated with a session:

         M-x haskell-debug

   It will open a buffer that looks like this:

         Debugging haskell

         You have to load a module to start debugging.

         g - refresh

         Modules

         No loaded modules.

14.11.2 Loading modules
-----------------------

To debug anything you need to load something into GHCi.  Switch to a
normal file, for example:

     main = do putStrLn "Hello!"
               putStrLn "World"

   and load it into GHCi (‘C-c C-l’).  Now when you hit ‘g’ (to refresh)
in the debugging buffer, you’ll see something like:


         Debugging haskell

         b - breakpoint, g - refresh

         Context

         Not debugging right now.

         Breakpoints

         No active breakpoints.

         Modules

         Main - hello.hs

14.11.3 Setting a breakpoint
----------------------------

To set a breakpoint hit ‘b’ in the debugger buffer.  It will prompt for
a name.  Enter ‘main’ and hit ‘RET’.

   Now the buffer will look like this:

         Debugging haskell

         s - step into an expression, b - breakpoint
         d - delete breakpoint, g - refresh

         Context

         Not debugging right now.

         Breakpoints

         0 - Main (1:8)

         Modules

         Main - hello.hs

14.11.4 Start stepping
----------------------

Hit ‘s’ to step through an expression: it will prompt for an expression
to evaluate and step through.  Enter ‘main’ and hit ‘RET’.  Now the
buffer will look like this:

         Debugging haskell

         s - step into an expression, b - breakpoint
         d - delete breakpoint, a - abandon context, c - continue
         p - previous step, n - next step
         g - refresh

         Context

         main - hello.hs (stopped)

         do putStrLn "Hello!"
            putStrLn "World"

         _result :: IO () = _

            1 do putStrLn "Hello!" putStrLn "World"

         Breakpoints

         0 - Main (1:8)

         Modules

         Main - hello.hs

   What we see here is the current expression being evaluated:

     do putStrLn "Hello!"
        putStrLn "World"

   And we see the type of it:

     _result :: IO () = _

   And we see a backtrace of steps so far:

     1 do putStrLn "Hello!" putStrLn "World"

14.11.5 Continue stepping
-------------------------

To continue stepping, just hit ‘s’ again.  Now the context will change
to:

     main - hello.hs (stopped)

     putStrLn "Hello!"

     _result :: IO () = _

        1 do putStrLn "Hello!" putStrLn "World"

   Hitting ‘s’ once more, we see the context change to:

     putStrLn "World"

     _result :: IO () = _

        2 putStrLn "Hello!"
        1 do putStrLn "Hello!" putStrLn "World"

   Finally hitting ‘s’ again will say "Computation finished".  Hitting
‘s’ a final time will change the display back to:

         Debugging haskell

         s - step into an expression, b - breakpoint
         d - delete breakpoint, g - refresh

         Context

         Finished debugging.

            2 putStrLn "Hello!"
            1 do putStrLn "Hello!" putStrLn "World"

         Breakpoints

         1 - Main (1:8)

         Modules

         Main - hello.hs

   And you’re done debugging.

15 Editing Cabal files
**********************

‘haskell-cabal-mode’ is a major mode for editing Cabal package
description files
(http://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html) and
is automatically associated with files having a ‘.cabal’ extension.

   For quickly locating and jumping to the nearest ‘.cabal’ file from a
Haskell source buffer, you can use ‘M-x haskell-cabal-visit-file’; with
a prefix argument (i.e.  ‘C-u’) ‘find-file-other-window’ is used to
visit the ‘.cabal’ file.  ‘haskell-cabal-visit-file’ is bound to the key
sequence ‘C-c v c’.

File: haskell-mode.info,  Node: Browsing Haddocks,  Next: Spell checking strings and comments,  Prev: Editing Cabal files,  Up: Top

16 Browsing Haddocks using ‘w3m’
********************************

An experimental feature is use of the w3m browser to browse Haddock docs
inside Emacs.

16.1 Get w3m
============

Most Linux distributions will have a package for the binary:

     $ sudo apt-get install w3m

   Now grab ‘w3m.el’ from:

   • <http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/>
   • ‘M-x’ ‘package-install’ ‘RET’ ‘w3m’ ‘RET’

   Confirm installation by trying ‘M-x’ ‘w3m-browse-url’ ‘RET’
‘haskell.org’ ‘RET’.

   If this works, you’re good to go.

16.2 Configure w3m
==================

Now that you have w3m, you probably want to configure it to be more of a
passive viewer than a full-fledged browser.  For example:

     (setq w3m-mode-map (make-sparse-keymap))

     (define-key w3m-mode-map (kbd "RET") 'w3m-view-this-url)
     (define-key w3m-mode-map (kbd "q") 'bury-buffer)
     (define-key w3m-mode-map (kbd "<mouse-1>") 'w3m-maybe-url)
     (define-key w3m-mode-map [f5] 'w3m-reload-this-page)
     (define-key w3m-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-d") 'haskell-w3m-open-haddock)
     (define-key w3m-mode-map (kbd "M-<left>") 'w3m-view-previous-page)
     (define-key w3m-mode-map (kbd "M-<right>") 'w3m-view-next-page)
     (define-key w3m-mode-map (kbd "M-.") 'w3m-haddock-find-tag)

     (defun w3m-maybe-url ()
       (interactive)
       (if (or (equal '(w3m-anchor) (get-text-property (point) 'face))
               (equal '(w3m-arrived-anchor) (get-text-property (point) 'face)))
           (w3m-view-this-url)))

16.3 Import w3m-haddock
=======================

It’s not enabled by default in haskell-mode at present, so you need to
import it manually:

     (require 'w3m-haddock)

16.4 Add a hook for w3m
=======================

In order to make haddock pages a little more palatable (and add syntax
highlighting to source view), you can add this hook:

     (add-hook 'w3m-display-hook 'w3m-haddock-display)

   It’s a little rough around the edges, but it’s a start.

16.5 Configure your package locations
=====================================

By default, the package locations is set to:

     (defcustom haskell-w3m-haddock-dirs
       '("~/.cabal/share/doc/"))

   If you are using an hsenv or a custom package directory, you should
configure this variable with M-x customize-variable or by writing the
custom-set-variables code for it.

16.6 Finally
============

You did all that!  Now you’re ready to bind a useful key:

     (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-d") 'haskell-w3m-open-haddock)

   Now when you press ‘C-c’ ‘C-d’ it will prompt for a package to browse
to.

   This feature will be improved gradually as time goes on.


File: haskell-mode.info,  Node: Spell checking strings and comments,  Next: Aligning code,  Prev: Browsing Haddocks,  Up: Top

17 Using with ‘flyspell-prog-mode’
**********************************

Strings and comments can be checked for spelling mistakes.  There is a
standard Emacs mode for this purpose, ‘flyspell-prog-mode’, that can be
enabled in Haskell buffers.  Spelling errors are underlined using
squiggly red lines.

   Documentation for ‘flyspell-prog-mode’ can be found in *Note
(emacs)Spelling::.  Here we point to a couple of useful keybindings:

   • ‘M-$’ - Check and correct spelling of the word at point
     (‘ispell-word’).

   • ‘digit’ - Replace the word, just this time, with one of the
     displayed near-misses.  Each near-miss is listed with a digit; type
     that digit to select it.

   • ‘SPC’ - Skip this word—continue to consider it incorrect, but don’t
     change it here.

   To enable spell checking of strings and comments add this line to
your ‘~/.emacs’ file:

   ‘(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'flyspell-prog-mode)’

18 Aligning code
****************

Select a region you want to align text within, ‘M-x’ ‘align-regexp’, and
type a regexp representing the alignment delimiter.

   For example, I often line up my Haddock comments:

     f :: a -- ^ does a
       -> Foo b -- ^ and b
       -> c -- ^ to c

   Select the region, and let the regexp be ‘--’:

     f :: a     -- ^ does a
       -> Foo b -- ^ and b
       -> c     -- ^ to c

   Of course, this works for just about anything.  Personally, I’ve
globally bound it to ‘C-x a r’:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x a r") 'align-regexp)

   Note that you can also just use the rules below for telling the
aligner about Haskell.  Once you evaluate this, you can just use ‘M-x’
‘align’, which I like to bind to ‘M-[’.

     (add-to-list 'align-rules-list
                  '(haskell-types
                    (regexp . "\\(\\s-+\\)\\(::\\|∷\\)\\s-+")
                    (modes quote (haskell-mode literate-haskell-mode))))
     (add-to-list 'align-rules-list
                  '(haskell-assignment
                    (regexp . "\\(\\s-+\\)=\\s-+")
                    (modes quote (haskell-mode literate-haskell-mode))))
     (add-to-list 'align-rules-list
                  '(haskell-arrows
                    (regexp . "\\(\\s-+\\)\\(->\\|→\\)\\s-+")
                    (modes quote (haskell-mode literate-haskell-mode))))
     (add-to-list 'align-rules-list
                  '(haskell-left-arrows
                    (regexp . "\\(\\s-+\\)\\(<-\\|←\\)\\s-+")
                    (modes quote (haskell-mode literate-haskell-mode))))

19 Using rectangular region commands
************************************

Emacs has a set of commands which operate on the region as if it were
rectangular.  This turns out to be extremely useful when dealing with
whitespace sensitive languages.

   • ‘C-x r o’ is "Open Rectangle".

     It will shift any text within the rectangle to the right side.
     Also see:

   • ‘C-x r t’ is "String Rectangle".

     It will replace any text within the rectangle with the given string
     on all the lines in the region.  If comment-region didn’t already
     exist, you could use this instead, for example.

   • ‘C-x r d’ is "Delete Rectangle".

     It will delete the contents of the rectangle and move anything on
     the right over.

   • ‘C-x r r’ is "Copy Rectangle to Register".

     It will prompt you for a register number so it can save it for
     later.

   • ‘C-x r g’ is "Insert register".

     This will insert the contents of the given register, overwriting
     whatever happens to be within the target rectangle.  (So make room)

   • ‘C-x r k’ is "Kill rectangle".

     Delete rectangle and save contents for:

   • ‘C-x r y’ is "Yank rectangle".

     This will insert the contents of the last killed rectangle.

   As with all Emacs modifier combos, you can type ‘C-x r C-h’ to find
out what keys are bound beginning with the ‘C-x r’ prefix.
