;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package enables eldoc support when minibuffer is in use.
;;
;; Eldoc info is shown by default in mode-line,
;; but you can have eldoc info somewhere else by setting
;; `eldoc-in-minibuffer-show-fn' to another function (e.g `tooltip-show').
;;
;; By default with this package `M-:' will use `pp-eval-expression'
;; instead of `eval-expression'; you can change that by setting
;; `eldoc-eval-preferred-function'.
;;
;; It also provides a convenient macro to enable eldoc support
;; in your own functions using minibuffer or in your defadvices,
;; that is `with-eldoc-in-minibuffer'.
;;
;; Users of own minibuffer frame will have to set
;; `eldoc-in-minibuffer-own-frame-p' to non-nil.
;;
;; You can turn On/Off eldoc support in minibuffer any time
;; with `eldoc-in-minibuffer-mode'.
;;
;;; Install:
;; Add to .emacs:

;;   (autoload 'eldoc-in-minibuffer-mode "eldoc-eval")
